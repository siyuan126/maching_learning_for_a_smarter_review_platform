      "As I reviewed on the other pair of these I purchased (high waist in the color sea green). These leggings are low cost with high quality craftsmanship and materials. Soft and durable, not see through regardless of how much you stretch them! I have recommended them to several people!\n",
      "I bought these pants a few months ago and LOVE them so I bought another pair. New pair has a different fabric makeup and are awful. The new ones are see-through too. Bring back the old ones!\n",
      "Lavender grey is shown as a light grey color and the lavender grey I got was the same color as violet storm. They fit well, a tad smaller than other 90 degree leggings I have... Ill have to return I guess but I'd like the actual lavender grey leggings.\n",
      "I ordered this twice the black pair. First time i got long dark grey and they r not 90 degree they r some off brand! Second time I got what I ordered. Hoping they make the first order right for me. I love love love these leggings and have about 15 pair 😂\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely love it. The color along with the comfortability makes it a very good purchase. I plan to buy more...\n",
      "I ordered three pairs of these leggings.  The first one I took out of the package had a hole in the seam of the left leg.  It looked like it haf been returned because the packaging was not the same as the other two pairs of leggings.  The one with the tear also did not have the 90 Degree tag with it either.  I returned those for a refund.  The other two pair I really am happy with however one of the items was not the color I ordered however; I liked it and kept it.\n",
      "Love these yoga pants\n",
      "Very comfortable - material is nice\n",
      "Wow. Love these. Soft, good amount of stretch and squat proof! Waist band comes up high and stays in place. Purchased bc of a YouTube review I watched and am very pleased. They last through my crossfit wod and look good when I go to the grocery after.\n",
      "Love the feel of the fabric but they run way too small.\n",
      "These are AMAZING. The fit is fantastic. They do not show anything when bending over. Love,love them. Four pair for the price of one Lucy pair.\n",
      "These leggings are so comfortable! I put they fit somewhat large because of how stretchy they are. They are perfect for hiding the muffin top unlike other leggings in the same size. They also have a small hidden pocket that is perfect for holding keys!\n",
      "Love these leggings - nice thick material (not see through) and the length is perfection. I am 5'7&#34; about 145 lbs and ordered the medium. They come up just below my belly button, which I love for it's love handle cinching quality.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE these leggings! They are so comfortable and I love that they are somewhat high waisted. The material is thick and durable, not cheapy feeling at all. It goes on nice and smooth and isn't sheer or see through.  I worked out in them the other day and there was no problem, no sweat, it felt great.  I will absolutely most definitely, positively be purchasing more of these again and again!  I want to try the high waisted tummy control, I love high waisted leggings.\n",
      "Beautiful color!\n",
      "I have found that their sizing in general has changed a bit. Runs a little smaller than before. Fabric contents may have something to do with this change?  I have in fact even lost some weight so I'm sure that they are running smaller than previous purchases.\n",
      "These are my favorite leggings. Nice and thick and have great stretch\n",
      "These are my all time favorite workout pants. I am 5'7&#34; and I have a hard time finding crop pants that are not almost at my knees. These are more like ankle length or slightly above and I love them. Bought 5 pairs.\n",
      "I love these.  The material is great.\n",
      "These are the best capris ever!!!  They are so compfy and they look awesome on me!!!  I ordered two pairs on accident but I'm not even returning them because I'll wear them so much I my as well keep them.\n",
      "I was hesitant to try Yoga pants for exercise, but they are great.  since I have worn mine, several other women in my group are wearing yoga pants too.  The 90 degree is perfect, comfortable, looks great.  Can't say enough good about them.  I did read the reviews and ordered XL instead of L and they are a good fit.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE PANTS! Fits true to size for reference I'm 5'2 125 lbs and got a small. I've spent hundreds on designer workout pants and after these I'm never going back! Really great colors that stay true even after washing!\n",
      "Very comfy yoga pants with great style! Great price too!\n",
      "Perfect fit! Love them!\n",
      "Love it. I will buy another one soon.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "I returned them. Too small\n",
      "Just like the pair I bought in a Department store. It' even has the same Item Number. I was surprised!  🤗\n",
      "Did not like the quality or the fit. Gave me an awful muffin top! Spent the extra money and bought a pair from Zella. Worth every penny!!\n",
      "Love these yoga pants. They don't roll down and fit great. They also wash well. I want more colors now. I have black and gray but will be adding to my yoga wardrobe.\n",
      "Extremely comfortable, durable, and wonderful! I am so thankful that I found awesome workout pants that I was able to buy in every color of the rainbow because they were so affordable!!!\n",
      "Nice light weight flexible comfortable yoga pants. It's hard to find yoga pants that don't feel heavy and hot. It's hard for me to workout in uncomfortable clothing. Also bought the tops to match.\n",
      "I absolutely love these, Great colors and quality for the price.\n",
      "A little lighter than pictured, but otherwise a great pair of workout pants! Love 90 Degree, their active wear never disappoints.\n",
      "Love them, color is great and super comfy!\n",
      "Love these! Such a great price, comfortable, and the perfect length!\n",
      "Product is alright, first time I wore them the strings already started coming undone.\n",
      "I love these leggings! I ordered the &#34;purple impressions&#34; color, although they don't really look purple, they look much more blue than purple (see picture) I still love the color. They are very comfortable, and not see-through which is a major plus. I would definitely ordered these in other colors :)\n",
      "These pants are AMAZING!! So comfy and flexable! I can't wait to order more in every color\n",
      "Love the fit of these the heather charcoal changes color with swear but I still like the color.\n",
      "Very comfortable and a great fit. However, the black ones (made with 87% nylon) ARE SEE THROUGH. They do not pass the deadlift/squat test :) - trust me - but they would work for running/cardio/etc - just wouldn't recommend for leg day. The other pair I have - bright pink -- VERY hot pink - is made with more polyester and those are not see through. Hope that helps!\n",
      "the coral color seems to fit differently, maybe it's just the color is rather unflattering on me (i.e. cellulite central which isn't generally visible) when the other colors have been much more flattering.\n",
      "Material is great, might show a little cellulite if you have lots.\n",
      "I have been searching for the perfect pair of capris that are long enough where they won't ride up my legs and end up bunched at the knees. I'm a tall person. These are amazing and I will be buying more!! Comfortable, soft and not see through.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Love it.\n",
      "I wear a size 8 and I got a medium. They were too snug for my comfort and fit more like compression pants. I'll go up a size so I can wear them for yoga but won't feel like I'm on display if I have to run to the store in them.\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "They don't cut into your lady bits (no camel toe)\n",
      "They are thick and well made\n",
      "Provide support (if you want them tight)\n",
      "Priced right\n",
      "Cons\n",
      "They are too snug for yoga and every day wear.\n",
      "I can feel the horizontal seam in the crotch area (hoping this will be remedied with a larger size)\n",
      "you van see threw them\n",
      "I am 5'2. 132lbs. Usually a size small.\n",
      "My Purchase: color Sage - small\n",
      "I've had a pair of their leggings from Marshalls. This is my first purchase of their capris. I've worn these multiple times so I could give a more accurate review from my experience. I wash machine them in cold water & put them in the dryer.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "-Comfy fit & buttery feel\n",
      "-Doesn't suffocate\n",
      "-Not see through (did bent over test - could be because it's a bit loose on me, so the material isn't super stretched)\n",
      "-Keeps you cool through workout\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "-Not true to size for me (bit loose). Had to pull them up a few times while working out.\n",
      "-Due to the stitching down the crotch - beware of camel toe!\n",
      "-Crotch area fits a bit loose\n",
      "-Sweat stain (dries up quickly) doesn't bother me though\n",
      "All in all, I kept this pair. Still love it. Will purchase XS next order. Would highly recommend others to give it a go!\n",
      "These are sooooo comfortable and I love that they sit slightly high on my hips and hide my mommy tummy. Plus they're 'squat proof' (not see through), super soft, and don't make you overheat at the gym.\n",
      "Perfect, currently my favorite pair of leggings\n",
      "love the color and is very comfortable and supports perfectly!\n",
      "I bought these to wear on vacation with skirts and over-sized shirt. I am 5' 6&#34;, 125 lbs, I got a small and they fit snug/comfy. They are a bit more athletic (slight sheen) than I expected, but they are super comfortable and have a tiny change pocket hidden in front. Also, a long t-shirt or cotton dress slides nicely over them when I walk, which is nice.\n",
      "These leggings are so soft and the sage color is really nice.\n",
      "I really like the fit of these yoga pants. The material is soft and comfortable with just a little compression. This is my second pair. The only reason I didn't make it 5 stars is that the color was not as expected. I ordered &#34;lavender grey&#34; and expected, based on the product photos, for it to be a darker grey with just a tint of purple, but these are basically light lilac.\n",
      "Good quality and fit.  No roll down or up of the waistband during yoga sessions.  Very comfortable. Have already ordered a 2nd pair.\n",
      "Love the quality and price of these leggings!! You won't be disappointed! There's even a hidden pocket for your phone/cash.\n",
      "If you're short like me (5'3&#34;), you'll probably have to roll them up at the bottom. They're cropped but they fit awkwardly on my calf. Not bad at all for the price.\n",
      "absolutely love them but i will be getting x small next time. a must buy.\n",
      "Very nice high quality product. Washes well. Feels great.\n",
      "Love! Great material\n",
      "Impressed... As a LuluLemon lover.  These pants are comfortable, high waisted, seem to be a great material.\n",
      "Really comfortable and fits well!\n",
      "The leggings are more high-waisted than in the photo but the fit is good, my wife is 5' 2&#34;, 130lbs & the small fits her well.\n",
      "90 Degree make the BEST workout pants. Own probably 4 different pairs of pants by this company. I purchased the magenta color this time to add to my collection. I love these pants because they are soft, comfortable, breathable, fitted just right to accent my features and the best part is they are thick and NOT see through!! I wear these for all of my different work out classes and they are great. I wash them in cold and hang dry, they last a long time and don't fade. I am 5'9, around 150 and can wear a medium or large. I got a large in these.\n",
      "These were great -- the small was a tiny bit snug but not really a problem. I'm 5'5&#34; and these were just a little longer than pictured, but I'm used to my pants being kind of long because models are usually several inches taller than me. I just scrunched them up a bit at the ankle to look more like capris. The length actually makes them very versatile because they can seem like regular length leggings or capris on someone my height depending on how you wear them. The material was nice and thick while still being breathable. I've washed them a couple of times and they still look new. Overall I'm very impressed by this brand and the quality of their products for such a low price!\n",
      "These are literally the perfect pants. If your weight fluctuates, these pants always fit and look good. I live in these!!!\n",
      "I love this company, soft, fits true to size, beautiful colors and lasts all my crazy workouts!\n",
      "I love these yoga pants, they fit great,feel good,  they are not see through.  I have them now in 2 colors and plan to get a few more colors.  I would definetly recommend these !\n",
      "I bought these a side larger since I already owned a pair from TJMax and love them. I was happy to find another pair on Amozon.\n",
      "I have about 5 pair of these pants. They fit great and are a really good quality. They don't roll down, they stay put and don't restrict movement in any way. Also I am really short so it's hard to find pants that don't bunch up at the ankle, I find these work great as full length for me.\n",
      "Perfectly fitting, comfortable, and opaque everyday leggings for wearing constantly. I will be ordering again!\n",
      "My wife loves them. Super soft and comfy. Fits good.\n",
      "Good value. Launder nicely. thick enough to conceal under garment. Wish they came in white and maybe a little shorter (the reason for the 4 STARS). Very satisfied with the quality and wearability. My go to brand...will order again.\n",
      "This brand has turned into my favorite brand of leggings. I can put them in the wash and dryer and they're still holding up....color, stretch, and all.\n",
      "These Capri's will draw a lot of attention because the color is so bright. I ordered XS because I like them to stay up on my waist, I typically wear a size 4 so I can also go up in size to a small if I want to but for some reasons the smalls don't really stay up as I like them to.  Very stretchable a not see through at all.... you will love them!\n",
      "I wanted to keep these so bad! They seem great quality and fit great everywhere except the waist...they ran extremely small!\n",
      "Not a whole lot to say except that these are GREAT capris pants.\n",
      "These leggings are perfect and look great on me. I bought them to wear to yoga and gym classes but they look so good I think\n",
      "I will save them for dressier occasions.\n",
      "Love these pants! They are super comfy, super stretchy and great for the gym and lounging around. They are not see through at all when you bend over which is great.\n",
      "They were a bit snug but I kind of prefer it that way as they don't move much when i work out.\n",
      "For reference, I ordered a small and I am 5'4&#34;, 130lbs and am not super thin through the thighs and hips.\n",
      "Super comfortable and the best part is it holds everything in place like my stomach! Other workout pants I've tried tend to roll down and I was constantly adjusting.\n",
      "This is my husband's account, but I bought these for myself. For the value, these pants are awesome. You can't see through them (I have $98 lulu's and you can), they have enough elastic to feel support, yet they are durable (I was constantly) and comfortable. The waist can be slightly tight but it's not too bad. I ordered 5 pairs in different colors and sizes.\n",
      "These pants are very comfy, fit as expected and I love that they offer them in ao many colors. But beware, they are see through in the back, definitely NOT gym/ squat approved and I would venture to say, probably not for that downeard dog in yoga either. If you are OK with your special parts playing peek-a-boo, then by all means buy these pants. Otherwise, these would be good for lounging around and running errands.\n",
      "perfect fit...love them !!\n",
      "Beautiful sage green and perfect fit!\n",
      "around the calves its a little large and does not hug my foot. maybe if i had gotten a smaller size it would work better\n",
      "Have bought 6-8 pairs of these leggings. Amazing! Squat proof! I'm a size 4/6 and bought mediums. Fit perfect. Will keep buying!\n",
      "I have had two pairs of these before that I had purchased at Marshalls so knew exactly how they fit and the nice quality of them.  I especially like that they have a small pocket in the waistband where you can put some money, a credit card or license, keys, etc. so you can be hands free.  They are of a good quality material that has stretch, some firmness control and no telltale see through.\n",
      "they fit fine, but the color I got was very see through! I can not speak for the other colors but the silver is transparent\n",
      "nice fit\n",
      "great product!! good tummy control! 5'7 140 medium fits perfect\n",
      "I like the color, length, and soft fabric however I wish it would be a little bit thinner.\n",
      "Absolutely love this brand of leggings. These are true squat non see through Capri! They feel so comfortable I wear them everyday even underneath my skirts and dresses.\n",
      "These capris fit very nicely.  Not a capri-wearing lady, but after recent abdominal surgery, I needed some stretchy-style pants to wear until I could fit into my regular clothes.\n",
      "These were really comfortable and the color is very versatile.\n",
      "Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars:  I ordered 2 different brands of capris, and one of them is now spamming me with email marketing messages.  DO NOT appreciate that!\n",
      "Love, love, love these pants! Absolutely a must have! I have the &#34;mom stomach&#34; and these help control it ☺️\n",
      "I love love love these capris. They are a great value, the cut is complementary, and the length is perfect (I'm 5' 6&#34;). Just the thing I need to wear with tunics and tees and sandals. They'll be perfect for fall, too, with my Converse. I ordered 3 of these and already own 4 of the longer length yoga pants from 90 Degree by Reflex.\n",
      "I really like the quality of these yoga pants but I wish they had a length option for shorter people. I'm 5'5&#34; and I ordered the cropped ones and they awkwardly end just above my ankles not at my calves like I expected.\n",
      "They fit to size, feel amazing and I look thinner lol\n",
      "Seriously they are well made and wash really good!\n",
      "None\n",
      "Perfect fit but a little long so i roll them up twice at the bottom. I am 5'2&#34;\n",
      "Very comfortable pants! I'm 5'2 and about 135 pounds and ordered a a black in medium, though I think I could've gotten away with a small. I have thicker thighs and calves and smaller waist, which means that many tights fit me too tight around my legs. However, this isn't a problem with these! I also love that they aren't see through.\n",
      "Overall, I'd definitely recommend and am considering ordering other colors.\n",
      "Love this company! Every pair of pants that I have purchased, and I think I have 5, are amazing! Great fit! Great feel! Will definitely continue to order. Company also has amazing customer service- after receiving a defective pair, they quickly shipped out a new pair.\n",
      "I love these. They are comfy not see through. I can wear them to work out or make them casual with a cute shirt and flip flops.\n",
      "These pants are utterly amazing!!! I've bought pants for triple the cost that don't fit as well as these do! They stay up over your belly if you have one left over like me from kids! I also have bigger legs and they compress but don't cut off circulation! I am going back to buy 3 more pairs!!\n",
      "Love these!\n",
      "Fit great! Passes the bend over test. Material is thick but not heavy. I was concerned that the light color would show cellulite on the back of my legs but it camouflaged wonderfully! The color is vibrant and fun!\n",
      "None\n",
      "None\n",
      "Bought these to match a specific workout top and while the color is nice, the fit and material aren't particularly flattering, and what's worse is they show every drop of sweat... even in the knees (yeah, who knew knees sweat?!) but the crotch area was particularly mortifying. These might be fine for yoga but wouldn't recommend for anything more sweaty or strenuous than that.\n",
      "None\n",
      "I'm very athletic, with a smaller than normal waist due to my weight lifting & high levels of cardio, so they fit a little large around the waist!\n",

      "Product was exactly as described, fit great, & was the perfect length\n",

      "Love these capri leggings.  Great fit.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE. most comfortable leggings EVER.  I'm buying 2 more pair!\n",
      "They are not tight around the calves/ankle, and have weird creases in odd places that don't go away which makes these look cheap. I love the sage color, but the fit is weird around the lower leg. Wish the sage color came in full length.\n",
      "These are my favorite Capri yoga pants. I've bought 2 pairs of them and I wear them all the time. I'm 4'10 so they fit more like a crop pant than a Capri but either way I still love them!\n",

      "I wear leggings a lot and these are my favorite cropped-length leggings.  I think there is a difference between capris and cropped, and I prefer the latter, finding it longer.

Really comfortable to wear and perfect for either cardio or weight lifting. Definitely recommend!\n",
      "I love these pants. I own around 4 pairs of leggings from this brand and these are by far the best. I am 5'4&#34; 120lb and I ordered a small in the lavender gray and they fit wonderfully. I recommend ordering these!!\n",
      "these are awesome for the price!\n",

      "I love these leggings. They are my go to for pilates. Insanely comfortable and they cover all the goods from behind and are completely opaque. Will buy again.\n",
      "Not as long as pictured on the website. I know they said capri, but the photo shown appeared to be more of an ankle pant. I'm only 5' tall, and these were quite short on me. Shame, because I do really love the other products this brand makes.\n",
      "Perfect for cycling and working out. I ordered a Large (I'm 5 ft 6in, 160 pounds) but it was a little loose, especially around the waist. However, I'm giving it 5 stars since it is so comfortable! I like wearing it even when I'm not working out because of the soft texture, and the fact that it slips down a little bit doesn't bother me. Probably ordering another in Medium.\n",
      "Fit perfect. Love them.\n",
      "Color in the picture is way off. I thought it would be more of the bright color like the picture but instead its a light aqua color that i'm now afraid to wear because it will get way too dirty.\n",
      "Great fit and quality.\n",
      "Considering the reviews on these leggings I was expecting much better quality. Thin material, definitely not to be worn without something covering your butt/front because it would be see through for sure.\n",
      "If your'e looking for nicer leggings for yoga/exercise/everything, try Zella. You can get them on Ebay, typically around $40, but after trying these leggings the $40 is well worth it. Zella's leggings are way thicker and more reliable.\n",
      "Live in these. The are super comfy, fit well, and don't stretch out.\n",
      "Super cute! Love that the material is thicker so they aren't see through.\n",
      "These pants are amazingly flattering. Honestly, they are a distraction from my workouts because I can't stop looking at my butt in the mirror.\n",
      "These leggings have a lot of potential.. they are a great material and NOT see through. I'm well endowed in the rear end and finding leggings that aren't see through and $100 is difficult. The only thing is that these leggings are a little big in the crotch area and don't stay up that well so I definitely don't recommend for working out.\n",
      "I love love these yoga power flex capris!!they fit great!shipping was fast.great buy!!\n",
      "Love these workout leggings. They are high waisted so they hold everything in place. They don't roll down when you bend over. The length is perfect. Everything stays put through my workout and I'm not tugging on my leggings every few minutes. I want every color now!\n",
      "Love them so much!! Wear them all the time at the gym, they're extremely stretchy and comfortable.\n",
      "** Warning! Ive had my pair for over 6 months now, and use them often... the pants really start to become more loose over time and stretch out. So if I buy them again, I might even go a size smaller because they've stretched out by now.\n",
      "Great material and not see through! I love them. More comfortable than any nikes I've ever bought/worn.\n",
      "These are perfect. So soft, not see through at all, and great fit. Just the right amount of compression. I already ordered more. And they don't retain any sweat odor either\n",
      "Great basic capris for running or yoga.\n",
      "I love these. I have only had them about a month, so I can't speak for wear and tear yet. But the fit is great. It doesn't roll down my waist so I'm not hiking them up all the time. They are comfortable, I'm 5'9 and they come down just below mid calf. I do not feel they are 100% not see through. So I personally wear a long shirt with them, unless I'm working out home. But I also have a big booty. In a smaller gal, they probs my are not see through at all.\n",
      "-Beca\n",
      "a little on the small side\n",
      "they are a good length and the color is as expected.\n",
      "As I reviewed on the other pair of these I purchased (high waist in the color sea green). These leggings are low cost with high quality craftsmanship and materials. Soft and durable, not see through regardless of how much you stretch them! I have recommended them to several people!\n",
      "I bought these pants a few months ago and LOVE them so I bought another pair. New pair has a different fabric makeup and are awful. The new ones are see-through too. Bring back the old ones!\n",
      "Lavender grey is shown as a light grey color and the lavender grey I got was the same color as violet storm. They fit well, a tad smaller than other 90 degree leggings I have... Ill have to return I guess but I'd like the actual lavender grey leggings.\n",
      "I ordered this twice the black pair. First time i got long dark grey and they r not 90 degree they r some off brand! Second time I got what I ordered. Hoping they make the first order right for me. I love love love these leggings and have about 15 pair 😂\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely love it. The color along with the comfortability makes it a very good purchase. I plan to buy more...\n",
      "I ordered three pairs of these leggings.  The first one I took out of the package had a hole in the seam of the left leg.  It looked like it haf been returned because the packaging was not the same as the other two pairs of leggings.  The one with the tear also did not have the 90 Degree tag with it either.  I returned those for a refund.  The other two pair I really am happy with however one of the items was not the color I ordered however; I liked it and kept it.\n",
      "Love these yoga pants\n",
      "Very comfortable - material is nice\n",
      "Wow. Love these. Soft, good amount of stretch and squat proof! Waist band comes up high and stays in place. Purchased bc of a YouTube review I watched and am very pleased. They last through my crossfit wod and look good when I go to the grocery after.\n",
      "Love the feel of the fabric but they run way too small.\n",
      "These are AMAZING. The fit is fantastic. They do not show anything when bending over. Love,love them. Four pair for the price of one Lucy pair.\n",
      "These leggings are so comfortable! I put they fit somewhat large because of how stretchy they are. They are perfect for hiding the muffin top unlike other leggings in the same size. They also have a small hidden pocket that is perfect for holding keys!\n",
      "Love these leggings - nice thick material (not see through) and the length is perfection. I am 5'7&#34; about 145 lbs and ordered the medium. They come up just below my belly button, which I love for it's love handle cinching quality.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE these leggings! They are so comfortable and I love that they are somewhat high waisted. The material is thick and durable, not cheapy feeling at all. It goes on nice and smooth and isn't sheer or see through.  I worked out in them the other day and there was no problem, no sweat, it felt great.  I will absolutely most definitely, positively be purchasing more of these again and again!  I want to try the high waisted tummy control, I love high waisted leggings.\n",
      "Beautiful color!\n",
      "I have found that their sizing in general has changed a bit. Runs a little smaller than before. Fabric contents may have something to do with this change?  I have in fact even lost some weight so I'm sure that they are running smaller than previous purchases.\n",
      "These are my favorite leggings. Nice and thick and have great stretch\n",
      "These are my all time favorite workout pants. I am 5'7&#34; and I have a hard time finding crop pants that are not almost at my knees. These are more like ankle length or slightly above and I love them. Bought 5 pairs.\n",
      "I love these.  The material is great.\n",
      "These are the best capris ever!!!  They are so compfy and they look awesome on me!!!  I ordered two pairs on accident but I'm not even returning them because I'll wear them so much I my as well keep them.\n",
      "I was hesitant to try Yoga pants for exercise, but they are great.  since I have worn mine, several other women in my group are wearing yoga pants too.  The 90 degree is perfect, comfortable, looks great.  Can't say enough good about them.  I did read the reviews and ordered XL instead of L and they are a good fit.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE PANTS! Fits true to size for reference I'm 5'2 125 lbs and got a small. I've spent hundreds on designer workout pants and after these I'm never going back! Really great colors that stay true even after washing!\n",

      "Extremely comfortable, durable, and wonderful! I am so thankful that I found awesome workout pants that I was able to buy in every color of the rainbow because they were so affordable!!!\n",
      "Nice light weight flexible comfortable yoga pants. It's hard to find yoga pants that don't feel heavy and hot. It's hard for me to workout in uncomfortable clothing. Also bought the tops to match.\n",

      "Product is alright, first time I wore them the strings already started coming undone.\n",
      "I love these leggings! I ordered the &#34;purple impressions&#34; color, although they don't really look purple, they look much more blue than purple (see picture) I still love the color. They are very comfortable, and not see-through which is a major plus. I would definitely ordered these in other colors :)\n",
      "These pants are AMAZING!! So comfy and flexable! I can't wait to order more in every color\n",
      "Love the fit of these the heather charcoal changes color with swear but I still like the color.\n",
      "Very comfortable and a great fit. However, the black ones (made with 87% nylon) ARE SEE THROUGH. They do not pass the deadlift/squat test :) - trust me - but they would work for running/cardio/etc - just wouldn't recommend for leg day. The other pair I have - bright pink -- VERY hot pink - is made with more polyester and those are not see through. Hope that helps!\n",
      "the coral color seems to fit differently, maybe it's just the color is rather unflattering on me (i.e. cellulite central which isn't generally visible) when the other colors have been much more flattering.\n",
      "Material is great, might show a little cellulite if you have lots.\n",
      "I have been searching for the perfect pair of capris that are long enough where they won't ride up my legs and end up bunched at the knees. I'm a tall person. These are amazing and I will be buying more!! Comfortable, soft and not see through.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Love it.\n",
      "I wear a size 8 and I got a medium. They were too snug for my comfort and fit more like compression pants. I'll go up a size so I can wear them for yoga but won't feel like I'm on display if I have to run to the store in them.\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "They don't cut into your lady bits (no camel toe)\n",
      "They are thick and well made\n",

      "Pros:\n",
      "-Comfy fit & buttery feel\n",
      "-Doesn't suffocate\n",
      "-Not see through (did bent over test - could be because it's a bit loose on me, so the material isn't super stretched)\n",

      "Cons:\n",
      "-Not true to size for me (bit loose). Had to pull them up a few times while working out.\n",
      "-Due to the stitching down the crotch - beware of camel toe!\n",

They are a bit more athletic (slight sheen) than I expected, but they are super comfortable and have a tiny change pocket hidden in front. Also, a long t-shirt or cotton dress slides nicely over them when I walk, which is nice.\n",

      "I really like the fit of these yoga pants. The material is soft and comfortable with just a little compression. This is my second pair. The only reason I didn't make it 5 stars is that the color was not as expected.

I love these pants because they are soft, comfortable, breathable, fitted just right to accent my features and the best part is they are thick and NOT see through!! I wear these for all of my different work out classes and they are great. I wash them in cold and hang dry, they last a long time and don't fade. I am 5'9, around 150 and can wear a medium or large.

      "I ordered this twice the black pair. First time i got long dark grey and they r not 90 degree they r some off brand! Second time I got what I ordered. Hoping they make the first order right for me. I love love love these leggings and have about 15 pair 😂\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely love it. The color along with the comfortability makes it a very good purchase. I plan to buy more...\n",
      "I ordered three pairs of these leggings.  The first one I took out of the package had a hole in the seam of the left leg.  It looked like it haf been returned because the packaging was not the same as the other two pairs of leggings.  The one with the tear also did not have the 90 Degree tag with it either.  I returned those for a refund.  The other two pair I really am happy with however one of the items was not the color I ordered however; I liked it and kept it.\n",
      "Love these yoga pants\n",
      "Very comfortable - material is nice\n",
      "Wow. Love these. Soft, good amount of stretch and squat proof! Waist band comes up high and stays in place. Purchased bc of a YouTube review I watched and am very pleased. They last through my crossfit wod and look good when I go to the grocery after.\n",
      "Love the feel of the fabric but they run way too small.\n",
      "These are AMAZING. The fit is fantastic. They do not show anything when bending over. Love,love them. Four pair for the price of one Lucy pair.\n",
      "These leggings are so comfortable! I put they fit somewhat large because of how stretchy they are. They are perfect for hiding the muffin top unlike other leggings in the same size. They also have a small hidden pocket that is perfect for holding keys!\n",
      "Love these leggings - nice thick material (not see through) and the length is perfection. I am 5'7&#34; about 145 lbs and ordered the medium. They come up just below my belly button, which I love for it's love handle cinching quality.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE these leggings! They are so comfortable and I love that they are somewhat high waisted. The material is thick and durable, not cheapy feeling at all. It goes on nice and smooth and isn't sheer or see through.  I worked out in them the other day and there was no problem, no sweat, it felt great.  I will absolutely most definitely, positively be purchasing more of these again and again!  I want to try the high waisted tummy control, I love high waisted leggings.\n",
      "Beautiful color!\n",
      "I have found that their sizing in general has changed a bit. Runs a little smaller than before. Fabric contents may have something to do with this change?  I have in fact even lost some weight so I'm sure that they are running smaller than previous purchases.\n",
      "These are my favorite leggings. Nice and thick and have great stretch\n",
      "These are my all time favorite workout pants. I am 5'7&#34; and I have a hard time finding crop pants that are not almost at my knees. These are more like ankle length or slightly above and I love them. Bought 5 pairs.\n",
      "I love these.  The material is great.\n",
      "These are the best capris ever!!!  They are so compfy and they look awesome on me!!!  I ordered two pairs on accident but I'm not even returning them because I'll wear them so much I my as well keep them.\n",
      "I was hesitant to try Yoga pants for exercise, but they are great.  since I have worn mine, several other women in my group are wearing yoga pants too.  The 90 degree is perfect, comfortable, looks great.  Can't say enough good about them.  I did read the reviews and ordered XL instead of L and they are a good fit.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE PANTS! Fits true to size for reference I'm 5'2 125 lbs and got a small. I've spent hundreds on designer workout pants and after these I'm never going back! Really great colors that stay true even after washing!\n",
      "Very comfy yoga pants with great style! Great price too!\n",
      "Perfect fit! Love them!\n",
      "Love it. I will buy another one soon.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "I returned them. Too small\n",
      "Just like the pair I bought in a Department store. It' even has the same Item Number. I was surprised!  🤗\n",
      "Did not like the quality or the fit. Gave me an awful muffin top! Spent the extra money and bought a pair from Zella. Worth every penny!!\n",
      "Love these yoga pants. They don't roll down and fit great. They also wash well. I want more colors now. I have black and gray but will be adding to my yoga wardrobe.\n",
      "Extremely comfortable, durable, and wonderful! I am so thankful that I found awesome workout pants that I was able to buy in every color of the rainbow because they were so affordable!!!\n",
      "Nice light weight flexible comfortable yoga pants. It's hard to find yoga pants that don't feel heavy and hot. It's hard for me to workout in uncomfortable clothing. Also bought the tops to match.\n",
      "I absolutely love these, Great colors and quality for the price.\n",
      "A little lighter than pictured, but otherwise a great pair of workout pants! Love 90 Degree, their active wear never disappoints.\n",
      "Love them, color is great and super comfy!\n",
      "Love these! Such a great price, comfortable, and the perfect length!\n",
      "Product is alright, first time I wore them the strings already started coming undone.\n",
      "I love these leggings! I ordered the &#34;purple impressions&#34; color, although they don't really look purple, they look much more blue than purple (see picture) I still love the color. They are very comfortable, and not see-through which is a major plus. I would definitely ordered these in other colors :)\n",
      "These pants are AMAZING!! So comfy and flexable! I can't wait to order more in every color\n",
      "Love the fit of these the heather charcoal changes color with swear but I still like the color.\n",
      "Very comfortable and a great fit. However, the black ones (made with 87% nylon) ARE SEE THROUGH. They do not pass the deadlift/squat test :) - trust me - but they would work for running/cardio/etc - just wouldn't recommend for leg day. The other pair I have - bright pink -- VERY hot pink - is made with more polyester and those are not see through. Hope that helps!\n",
      "the coral color seems to fit differently, maybe it's just the color is rather unflattering on me (i.e. cellulite central which isn't generally visible) when the other colors have been much more flattering.\n",
      "Material is great, might show a little cellulite if you have lots.\n",
      "I have been searching for the perfect pair of capris that are long enough where they won't ride up my legs and end up bunched at the knees. I'm a tall person. These are amazing and I will be buying more!! Comfortable, soft and not see through.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Love it.\n",
      "I wear a size 8 and I got a medium. They were too snug for my comfort and fit more like compression pants. I'll go up a size so I can wear them for yoga but won't feel like I'm on display if I have to run to the store in them.\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "They don't cut into your lady bits (no camel toe)\n",
      "They are thick and well made\n",
      "Provide support (if you want them tight)\n",
      "Priced right\n",
      "Cons\n",
      "They are too snug for yoga and every day wear.\n",
      "I can feel the horizontal seam in the crotch area (hoping this will be remedied with a larger size)\n",
      "you van see threw them\n",
      "I am 5'2. 132lbs. Usually a size small.\n",
      "My Purchase: color Sage - small\n",
      "I've had a pair of their leggings from Marshalls. This is my first purchase of their capris. I've worn these multiple times so I could give a more accurate review from my experience. I wash machine them in cold water & put them in the dryer.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "-Comfy fit & buttery feel\n",
      "-Doesn't suffocate\n",
      "-Not see through (did bent over test - could be because it's a bit loose on me, so the material isn't super stretched)\n",
      "-Keeps you cool through workout\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "-Not true to size for me (bit loose). Had to pull them up a few times while working out.\n",
      "-Due to the stitching down the crotch - beware of camel toe!\n",
      "-Crotch area fits a bit loose\n",
      "-Sweat stain (dries up quickly) doesn't bother me though\n",
      "All in all, I kept this pair. Still love it. Will purchase XS next order. Would highly recommend others to give it a go!\n",
      "These are sooooo comfortable and I love that they sit slightly high on my hips and hide my mommy tummy. Plus they're 'squat proof' (not see through), super soft, and don't make you overheat at the gym.\n",
      "Perfect, currently my favorite pair of leggings\n",
      "love the color and is very comfortable and supports perfectly!\n",
      "I bought these to wear on vacation with skirts and over-sized shirt. I am 5' 6&#34;, 125 lbs, I got a small and they fit snug/comfy. They are a bit more athletic (slight sheen) than I expected, but they are super comfortable and have a tiny change pocket hidden in front. Also, a long t-shirt or cotton dress slides nicely over them when I walk, which is nice.\n",
      "These leggings are so soft and the sage color is really nice.\n",
      "I really like the fit of these yoga pants. The material is soft and comfortable with just a little compression. This is my second pair. The only reason I didn't make it 5 stars is that the color was not as expected. I ordered &#34;lavender grey&#34; and expected, based on the product photos, for it to be a darker grey with just a tint of purple, but these are basically light lilac.\n",
      "Good quality and fit.  No roll down or up of the waistband during yoga sessions.  Very comfortable. Have already ordered a 2nd pair.\n",
      "Love the quality and price of these leggings!! You won't be disappointed! There's even a hidden pocket for your phone/cash.\n",
      "If you're short like me (5'3&#34;), you'll probably have to roll them up at the bottom. They're cropped but they fit awkwardly on my calf. Not bad at all for the price.\n",
      "absolutely love them but i will be getting x small next time. a must buy.\n",
      "Very nice high quality product. Washes well. Feels great.\n",
      "Love! Great material\n",
      "Impressed... As a LuluLemon lover.  These pants are comfortable, high waisted, seem to be a great material.\n",
      "Really comfortable and fits well!\n",
      "The leggings are more high-waisted than in the photo but the fit is good, my wife is 5' 2&#34;, 130lbs & the small fits her well.\n",
      "90 Degree make the BEST workout pants. Own probably 4 different pairs of pants by this company. I purchased the magenta color this time to add to my collection. I love these pants because they are soft, comfortable, breathable, fitted just right to accent my features and the best part is they are thick and NOT see through!! I wear these for all of my different work out classes and they are great. I wash them in cold and hang dry, they last a long time and don't fade. I am 5'9, around 150 and can wear a medium or large. I got a large in these.\n",
      "These were great -- the small was a tiny bit snug but not really a problem. I'm 5'5&#34; and these were just a little longer than pictured, but I'm used to my pants being kind of long because models are usually several inches taller than me. I just scrunched them up a bit at the ankle to look more like capris. The length actually makes them very versatile because they can seem like regular length leggings or capris on someone my height depending on how you wear them. The material was nice and thick while still being breathable. I've washed them a couple of times and they still look new. Overall I'm very impressed by this brand and the quality of their products for such a low price!\n",
      "These are literally the perfect pants. If your weight fluctuates, these pants always fit and look good. I live in these!!!\n",
      "I love this company, soft, fits true to size, beautiful colors and lasts all my crazy workouts!\n",
      "I love these yoga pants, they fit great,feel good,  they are not see through.  I have them now in 2 colors and plan to get a few more colors.  I would definetly recommend these !\n",
      "I bought these a side larger since I already owned a pair from TJMax and love them. I was happy to find another pair on Amozon.\n",
      "I have about 5 pair of these pants. They fit great and are a really good quality. They don't roll down, they stay put and don't restrict movement in any way. Also I am really short so it's hard to find pants that don't bunch up at the ankle, I find these work great as full length for me.\n",
      "Perfectly fitting, comfortable, and opaque everyday leggings for wearing constantly. I will be ordering again!\n",
      "My wife loves them. Super soft and comfy. Fits good.\n",
      "Good value. Launder nicely. thick enough to conceal under garment. Wish they came in white and maybe a little shorter (the reason for the 4 STARS). Very satisfied with the quality and wearability. My go to brand...will order again.\n",
      "This brand has turned into my favorite brand of leggings. I can put them in the wash and dryer and they're still holding up....color, stretch, and all.\n",
      "These Capri's will draw a lot of attention because the color is so bright. I ordered XS because I like them to stay up on my waist, I typically wear a size 4 so I can also go up in size to a small if I want to but for some reasons the smalls don't really stay up as I like them to.  Very stretchable a not see through at all.... you will love them!\n",
      "I wanted to keep these so bad! They seem great quality and fit great everywhere except the waist...they ran extremely small!\n",
      "Not a whole lot to say except that these are GREAT capris pants.\n",
      "These leggings are perfect and look great on me. I bought them to wear to yoga and gym classes but they look so good I think\n",
      "I will save them for dressier occasions.\n",
      "Love these pants! They are super comfy, super stretchy and great for the gym and lounging around. They are not see through at all when you bend over which is great.\n",
      "They were a bit snug but I kind of prefer it that way as they don't move much when i work out.\n",
      "For reference, I ordered a small and I am 5'4&#34;, 130lbs and am not super thin through the thighs and hips.\n",
      "Super comfortable and the best part is it holds everything in place like my stomach! Other workout pants I've tried tend to roll down and I was constantly adjusting.\n",
      "This is my husband's account, but I bought these for myself. For the value, these pants are awesome. You can't see through them (I have $98 lulu's and you can), they have enough elastic to feel support, yet they are durable (I was constantly) and comfortable. The waist can be slightly tight but it's not too bad. I ordered 5 pairs in different colors and sizes.\n",
      "These pants are very comfy, fit as expected and I love that they offer them in ao many colors. But beware, they are see through in the back, definitely NOT gym/ squat approved and I would venture to say, probably not for that downeard dog in yoga either. If you are OK with your special parts playing peek-a-boo, then by all means buy these pants. Otherwise, these would be good for lounging around and running errands.\n",
      "perfect fit...love them !!\n",
      "Beautiful sage green and perfect fit!\n",
      "around the calves its a little large and does not hug my foot. maybe if i had gotten a smaller size it would work better\n",
      "Have bought 6-8 pairs of these leggings. Amazing! Squat proof! I'm a size 4/6 and bought mediums. Fit perfect. Will keep buying!\n",
      "I have had two pairs of these before that I had purchased at Marshalls so knew exactly how they fit and the nice quality of them.  I especially like that they have a small pocket in the waistband where you can put some money, a credit card or license, keys, etc. so you can be hands free.  They are of a good quality material that has stretch, some firmness control and no telltale see through.\n",
      "they fit fine, but the color I got was very see through! I can not speak for the other colors but the silver is transparent\n",
      "nice fit\n",
      "great product!! good tummy control! 5'7 140 medium fits perfect\n",
      "I like the color, length, and soft fabric however I wish it would be a little bit thinner.\n",
      "Absolutely love this brand of leggings. These are true squat non see through Capri! They feel so comfortable I wear them everyday even underneath my skirts and dresses.\n",
      "These capris fit very nicely.  Not a capri-wearing lady, but after recent abdominal surgery, I needed some stretchy-style pants to wear until I could fit into my regular clothes.\n",
      "These were really comfortable and the color is very versatile.\n",
      "Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars:  I ordered 2 different brands of capris, and one of them is now spamming me with email marketing messages.  DO NOT appreciate that!\n",
      "Love, love, love these pants! Absolutely a must have! I have the &#34;mom stomach&#34; and these help control it ☺️\n",
      "I love love love these capris. They are a great value, the cut is complementary, and the length is perfect (I'm 5' 6&#34;). Just the thing I need to wear with tunics and tees and sandals. They'll be perfect for fall, too, with my Converse. I ordered 3 of these and already own 4 of the longer length yoga pants from 90 Degree by Reflex.\n",
      "I really like the quality of these yoga pants but I wish they had a length option for shorter people. I'm 5'5&#34; and I ordered the cropped ones and they awkwardly end just above my ankles not at my calves like I expected.\n",
      "They fit to size, feel amazing and I look thinner lol\n",
      "Seriously they are well made and wash really good!\n",
      "Will buy MANY many more of these pants! I was contemplating busting out $100 for some lulu. However, I found these originally at TjMaxx and fell in love with them immediately. They feel like skin, but not too thin. I've worn other very thin yoga pants that showed my cellulite, but these do NOT show through at all! I am 5'3&#34; and I do have to bunch them up jussstttt a little so the ankle/calf opening isn't gaping. Sort of expected at this height though.\n",
      "Perfect fit but a little long so i roll them up twice at the bottom. I am 5'2&#34;\n",
      "Very comfortable pants! I'm 5'2 and about 135 pounds and ordered a a black in medium, though I think I could've gotten away with a small. I have thicker thighs and calves and smaller waist, which means that many tights fit me too tight around my legs. However, this isn't a problem with these! I also love that they aren't see through.\n",
      "Overall, I'd definitely recommend and am considering ordering other colors.\n",
      "Love this company! Every pair of pants that I have purchased, and I think I have 5, are amazing! Great fit! Great feel! Will definitely continue to order. Company also has amazing customer service- after receiving a defective pair, they quickly shipped out a new pair.\n",
      "I love these. They are comfy not see through. I can wear them to work out or make them casual with a cute shirt and flip flops.\n",
      "These pants are utterly amazing!!! I've bought pants for triple the cost that don't fit as well as these do! They stay up over your belly if you have one left over like me from kids! I also have bigger legs and they compress but don't cut off circulation! I am going back to buy 3 more pairs!!\n",
      "Love these!\n",
      "Fit great! Passes the bend over test. Material is thick but not heavy. I was concerned that the light color would show cellulite on the back of my legs but it camouflaged wonderfully! The color is vibrant and fun!\n",
      "This was my 5 or 6th purchase of these pants. By far my favorite. Nice material that's not too thin. Fit just right.  Great price and I always receive quickly. They keep their shape even after laundering.\n",
      "Awesome quality with very high-end feel. Fit is perfect (XL for 190 lb weight). Very complementary. Bought these to wear as a capri-layer under tropical print boutique dress but they are substantial enough to wear as exercise tights without it looking tacky.  Looks fantastic!\n",
      "Bought these to match a specific workout top and while the color is nice, the fit and material aren't particularly flattering, and what's worse is they show every drop of sweat... even in the knees (yeah, who knew knees sweat?!) but the crotch area was particularly mortifying. These might be fine for yoga but wouldn't recommend for anything more sweaty or strenuous than that.\n",
      "Love these so much!\n",
      "I'm very athletic, with a smaller than normal waist due to my weight lifting & high levels of cardio, so they fit a little large around the waist!\n",
      "If you an average body, then these pants would probably fit perfectly\n",
      "Product was exactly as described, fit great, & was the perfect length\n",
      "Love these! I was looking for pink yoga pants- I actually bought these AND a pair from lululemon the same week... and I like these better!!\n",
      "The best darn deal for capris I have yet to discover.  They fit like a dream!  Medium is a medium.  The crotch behaves as one would hope as in no creeping up anywhere it should not.\n",
      "I tried on SO many pairs of work out pants and could not find any that fit the way I needed them to. I figured I would give these a try and they are amazing! The high waist gives acts as a control top and the fabric does not cut into my crotch in an unappealing way. Sorry for that visual but it is a real problem when it comes to these types of pants. I am very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "I LOVE these yoga pants.  I have a collection! BEST exercise pants I've found!\n",
      "New favorite pair of leggings! I've already ordered them in 3 different colors. I love the way they feel on and they are very flattering. Absolutely love!!!\n",
      "So comfy and such a great price!!\n",
      "Great quality but too big for me.\n",
      "Love these capri leggings.  Great fit.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE. most comfortable leggings EVER.  I'm buying 2 more pair!\n",
      "They are not tight around the calves/ankle, and have weird creases in odd places that don't go away which makes these look cheap. I love the sage color, but the fit is weird around the lower leg. Wish the sage color came in full length.\n",
      "These are my favorite Capri yoga pants. I've bought 2 pairs of them and I wear them all the time. I'm 4'10 so they fit more like a crop pant than a Capri but either way I still love them!\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Squat proof! love the color\n",
      "So comfortable! I am definitely going to be ordering some more in different colors!\n",
      "Love, love, love these workout capris!  Will buy more.  Absorbed the sweat real well, fit perfectly.  Comfortable.\n",
      "Literally the best workout leggings I've ever owned. I'm 5'4&#34; so they fit almost like a 7/8 legging. So comfortable and lightweight but not see-through.\n",
      "Love these leggings. Comparable to some other expensive brands at a quarter of the price.\n",
      "Love them they do have a little stretch so if you like em tight I think you can get away with a smaller size than usual\n",
      "Great value.  Holds up well after multiple washings ( in an old crappy machine)\n",
      "great pants\n",
      "They're ok. Not as great as I expected but would buy again. Equivalent to Old Navy capris\n",
      "I'm so happy I found these online! I'm 5'4&#34; and 150 lbs., size 8 but I ordered a size large. I think a medium might have been a better choice but I'm still very happy with these. I don't have &#34;cricket legs&#34; (chubby thighs rubbing together) and so far I haven't noted any pilling anywhere.  The colors are gorgeous, the material is cool and breathes even though it compresses nicely and holds everything where it should be. I'm a little bit overweight (I refuse to say curvy, because curvy to me is just a delicate way of saying I'm fat). I've been toning up and have been developing some decent muscle tone. I'm losing weight so will be back for more of these amazing capris later when I'm down another size!\n",
      "I love these yoga capris. I like that they have a slightly higher waist, they are extremely comfortable and fit perfectly.  I bought them in 3 colors.\n",
      "Great pants. Stretchy material.  They're not too tight and I can work out in them.  Running or squats aren't a problem.  The back stays in place and doesn't show off what color my undies are.\n",
      "Wow I love these pants! They are a nice, thick (not too thick, but substantial) material with a good amount of elasticity so they fit well and are super comfy. I bought them for the gym but wore them to work under a tunic because I couldn't wait to wear them. The material is thick and not at all see-through. I haven't washed them yet, so I can't say if they'll pill, but right now I'm very happy with them - I ordered two more pair...\n",
      "Fits very well and seems durable.\n",
      "These are great! I was so sick of buying capris that would ride up my calves and constantly need to be pulled down. I really love the length on these. I am 5'6 and they hit about 4 inches above my ankles, which is perfect. I've bought 3 pairs already (2 black, 1 spring navy) and I keep checking to see when charcoal will be available again in my size. All of aspects of the fit (the waist size, the stretch, etc) are also great. I highly recommend these!\n",
      "Overall fit as expected, but the legs are long for me to be Capri. I'm 5'3&#34; and they almost come to my ankles. High yoga waist was comfy.\n",
      "Oh my god. These leggings are AMAZING! They feel so buttery and smooth! I was a little bit worried about the sizing. I was torn between getting a medium or a large, but decided to go with the medium (if they were too small I figured I would use them as motivation haha). I wear a medium in Old Navy/Target leggings and these were actually a little loose in the waist. So glad I got the medium. For reference, I am 5'7 and weigh 165 lbs.\n",
      "I am not someone who feels the need to spend more than about $60 on workout leggings. But these are just as good as high end ones on the market.\n",
      "I'm currently sitting here deciding if I should buy all of them right now...\n",
      "I was skeptical when ordering these capris, simply because of the price. I have stuck with bigger athletic brands for leggings since I've never had a poor experience, but wanted to find comfortable, flattering and quality alternative to $50+ a pair. These are exactly what I needed. They are soft and breathable, but thick enough to conceal underwear lines. I will be ordering more!\n",
      "These are the best leggings!\n",
      "These are my favorite pair of yoga pants.  In fact, I've already purchased more!\n",
      "Love the control for the belly.  Good quality for the price!\n",
      "I have heard great things about 90 Degree yoga capris, but these were not for me. I ordered a size up based on reviews. They are incredibly comfortable and fit perfectly, but totally see through. I would think they would be great for everyday wear, but not exercise.\n",
      "These workout Capri leggings are amazing! I got the mango flame and they are the colored that is pictured. As for sizing I weigh 171lbs and I got a medium, it's fits perfect! They are comfy and super cute!\n",
      "I have these pants in blacknin a size small and the black size fits perfectly. These blue ones seem a tad big  I hope they don't stretch. They are very nice quality and thick and there is no show through and I love that! I am 5'6&#34; and 130 lbs athletic build and I wear a size small.\n",
      "I will never wear another brand of legging- these are perfect length (5'6&#34;), thickness, and texture.  Smoothes with no lines or show through.  I have 5 pairs and will purchase more.\n",
      "LOVE IT!!!\n",
      "Best leggings I've ever worn! They move with you but don't get loose during the day. I am 145 pounds 5'4 and the mediums are perfect fit. They stay true black too no fading!\n",
      "Great workout and yoga pants.  Fabric not too thin. May be somewhat larger than expected, but would purchase again.\n",
      "These are amazing! They're so comfy, not see through, fit awesome and GREAT quality! I'll definitely be buying another pair for sure!!\n",
      "These are the perfect capris, seriously. If you want them to be more &#34;tummy trimming&#34; order a size down.  The size you would generally wear will be comfortable, but not have the slimming.  I have purchased four pairs in two weeks, because I love them!\n",
      "I am a pear-shaped woman and these capris cover well.\n",
      "SO buttery soft!  The navy color is JUST what I have been searching for.  Nice compression around the belly helps pull everything in.\n",
      "Awesome color, awesome fit, great quality!\n",
      "These are my new favorite pants!! Wow they fit perfectly and so comfortable!! Excellent quality. Will be buying more of these!! I'm 130lbs and 5'3&#34; and ordered a small.\n",
      "I absolutely love this brand of yoga pants. I have 2 pairs and plan on buying more. They are a tad bigger than I thought they would be. But I think that's because I've lost weight and just got the size I usually get. I'm 5'3&#34; & 137lbs and the medium fits great, just a little loose in the crotch and waist area. Not enough to make my runs/walks uncomfortable. I will order a small next and add to this review. I hope this helps!\n",
      "These are great pants for the price. Fit is nice and they are well made.\n",
      "Love these!\n",
      "I might return these for a bigger size... I ordered these and the high waist full length ones (in black) in the same size. The other ones fit great, but these are a bit more see through than I'd like.\n",
      "I like these pants and they fit perfect however they took 10 whole days to get here.\n",
      "Nice and snug. Good fit. True to size. I ordered a small. I'm 5'1&#34; and 120. Comfortable for me to dance in and love the hidden pocket.\n",
      "The fabric is a little rough and offers less elasticity than expected.\n",
      "Best.Yoga. Pants. Ever!\n",
      "I've had these pants for like 3 years now and I LOVE them. They are great, and I plan on buying more from this brand!!\n",
      "Frankly the best workout wear I own\n",
      "These pants a awesome! They feel great on and are pretty close to sizes of any normal yoga pants. These are great because you can't see through them like many of the other yoga pants out there. Also, I find that they make your tummy look flatter and your butt looks nice too :).\n",
      "The company makes the best workout pants! Absolutely love them! They are comfortable, sit just right and don't fall down.\n",
      "Don't suggest this color for a lot of cardio though!\n",
      "I like them, but I bought them thinking that they would be a shorter version of the full length pair that I love...they aren't.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Shorter than I anticipated, more of a crop/capri but the fabric is so soft and comfortable, they sit high enough on the waist that they don't fall down when exercising, not see through and I love the sage color\n",
      "Love these! Great fit and great color\n",
      "These are one of the best yoga pants you will find. I have three pairs total and they are so well made and not see through at all. I highly recommend these!\n",
      "best yoga pants ever worn,sexy and comfortable,the yoga man.\n",
      "Fit perfectly. compression was not too much and they're opaque.  great\n",
      "Fit great.  May be see-through if a tighter fit.\n",
      "I really like these yoga pants and have them in several colors. However, after only a month, there is a hole in the crotch area.\n",
      "Love the fit and color!\n",
      "Fits perfect!! Holds in stomach and flattering on your peaches 🍑\n",
      "They fit as expected and are very comfortable. I recently started going to yoga classes and these are perfect. They are a bit heavier than others I looked at but I wanted something a bit heavier. They are very well made and I feel they will hold up well to many washings.\n",
      "I'm so pleased with this purchase!  I love the brilliant colors, which are true to the image on the screen, but even prettier in person.  The size seems totally as expected, if not a little cozier and stretchier than most yoga capris.  Love these so much!!!\n",
      "the most comfortable leggings! And they aren't see through.  I also have the regular length.  Plan to order more.\n",
      "great leggings. I've had them for over a year and they really hold up well. They're comfy, durable, and hold their shape.\n",
      "These are extremely soft and very comfy.\n",
      "Love love love these leggings!!! ❤️😊❤️\n",
      "Amazing and so comfortable! They don't fall down around the waistline! Perfect fit - I am 5'4&#34;/160# and usually wear a med. In most legging brands. I ordered a med. And they for lile a glove and are very soft and stretchy. Will order more colors!\n",
      "I love these leggings.  They fit great, they're comfortable and they aren't see through.  👍 I ordered them in black, I know the material and fit may differ for each color.\n",
      "I like the fit but the material is too thin in my opinion.\n",
      "I wear leggings a lot and these are my favorite cropped-length leggings.  I think there is a difference between capris and cropped, and I prefer the latter, finding it longer.  I usually wear a M and considered ordering these in L, but I'm glad I got the M's.  I ordered some bright colors that are great for summer.  These leggings are NOT see-through and some might consider them heavy, but I love how strong they are.\n",
      "Kinda see through and definitely not good for cellulite- these almost amplify it! Love the color though and super comfy!\n",
      "Comfortable cropped legging\n",
      "I am 5'4, 220 lbs and ordered a size small. I would 100% recommend these leggings!! They are so comfortable and flattering! They fit perfectly... great for exercise like yoga and barre because I have full range of motion in my legs and not constricting at all! . Also love to wear them casually during the day!\n",
      "These are really cute and fit great, wash great\n",
      "I'm short at 5' so these are more like yoga pants on me but I love them!\n",
      "I usually get a size Small in 90 Degree Leggings and they fit perfect! I am 5'5 and 130 pounds and I usually am a size medium in shorts however their small loose and not tight at all on me! I love them so much! I have so many pairs of these from a combination of TJMaxx and Amazon. I got the color sage this time and it is almost like a off-olive green and I love it so much! Really comfortable to wear and perfect for either cardio or weight lifting. Definitely recommend!\n",
      "I love these pants. I own around 4 pairs of leggings from this brand and these are by far the best. I am 5'4&#34; 120lb and I ordered a small in the lavender gray and they fit wonderfully. I recommend ordering these!!\n",
      "these are awesome for the price!\n",
      "These are a great fit and are not seethrough\n",
      "These feel like heaven when they're on!!! Love!\n",
      "Fit great! Very comfortable to work out in!\n",
      "I love these leggings. They are my go to for pilates. Insanely comfortable and they cover all the goods from behind and are completely opaque. Will buy again.\n",
      "Not as long as pictured on the website. I know they said capri, but the photo shown appeared to be more of an ankle pant. I'm only 5' tall, and these were quite short on me. Shame, because I do really love the other products this brand makes.\n",
      "Perfect for cycling and working out. I ordered a Large (I'm 5 ft 6in, 160 pounds) but it was a little loose, especially around the waist. However, I'm giving it 5 stars since it is so comfortable! I like wearing it even when I'm not working out because of the soft texture, and the fact that it slips down a little bit doesn't bother me. Probably ordering another in Medium.\n",
      "Fit perfect. Love them.\n",
      "Color in the picture is way off. I thought it would be more of the bright color like the picture but instead its a light aqua color that i'm now afraid to wear because it will get way too dirty.\n",
      "Great fit and quality.\n",
      "Considering the reviews on these leggings I was expecting much better quality. Thin material, definitely not to be worn without something covering your butt/front because it would be see through for sure.\n",
      "If your'e looking for nicer leggings for yoga/exercise/everything, try Zella. You can get them on Ebay, typically around $40, but after trying these leggings the $40 is well worth it. Zella's leggings are way thicker and more reliable.\n",
      "Live in these. The are super comfy, fit well, and don't stretch out.\n",
      "Super cute! Love that the material is thicker so they aren't see through.\n",
      "These pants are amazingly flattering. Honestly, they are a distraction from my workouts because I can't stop looking at my butt in the mirror.\n",
      "These leggings have a lot of potential.. they are a great material and NOT see through. I'm well endowed in the rear end and finding leggings that aren't see through and $100 is difficult. The only thing is that these leggings are a little big in the crotch area and don't stay up that well so I definitely don't recommend for working out.\n",
      "I love love these yoga power flex capris!!they fit great!shipping was fast.great buy!!\n",
      "Love these workout leggings. They are high waisted so they hold everything in place. They don't roll down when you bend over. The length is perfect. Everything stays put through my workout and I'm not tugging on my leggings every few minutes. I want every color now!\n",
      "Love them so much!! Wear them all the time at the gym, they're extremely stretchy and comfortable.\n",
      "** Warning! Ive had my pair for over 6 months now, and use them often... the pants really start to become more loose over time and stretch out. So if I buy them again, I might even go a size smaller because they've stretched out by now.\n",
      "Great material and not see through! I love them. More comfortable than any nikes I've ever bought/worn.\n",
      "These are perfect. So soft, not see through at all, and great fit. Just the right amount of compression. I already ordered more. And they don't retain any sweat odor either\n",
      "Great basic capris for running or yoga.\n",
      "I love these. I have only had them about a month, so I can't speak for wear and tear yet. But the fit is great. It doesn't roll down my waist so I'm not hiking them up all the time. They are comfortable, I'm 5'9 and they come down just below mid calf. I do not feel they are 100% not see through. So I personally wear a long shirt with them, unless I'm working out home. But I also have a big booty. In a smaller gal, they probs my are not see through at all.\n",
      "-Beca\n",
      "a little on the small side\n",
      "they are a good length and the color is as expected.\n",
      "As I reviewed on the other pair of these I purchased (high waist in the color sea green). These leggings are low cost with high quality craftsmanship and materials. Soft and durable, not see through regardless of how much you stretch them! I have recommended them to several people!\n",
      "I bought these pants a few months ago and LOVE them so I bought another pair. New pair has a different fabric makeup and are awful. The new ones are see-through too. Bring back the old ones!\n",
      "Lavender grey is shown as a light grey color and the lavender grey I got was the same color as violet storm. They fit well, a tad smaller than other 90 degree leggings I have... Ill have to return I guess but I'd like the actual lavender grey leggings.\n",
      "I ordered this twice the black pair. First time i got long dark grey and they r not 90 degree they r some off brand! Second time I got what I ordered. Hoping they make the first order right for me. I love love love these leggings and have about 15 pair 😂\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely love it. The color along with the comfortability makes it a very good purchase. I plan to buy more...\n",
      "I ordered three pairs of these leggings.  The first one I took out of the package had a hole in the seam of the left leg.  It looked like it haf been returned because the packaging was not the same as the other two pairs of leggings.  The one with the tear also did not have the 90 Degree tag with it either.  I returned those for a refund.  The other two pair I really am happy with however one of the items was not the color I ordered however; I liked it and kept it.\n",
      "Love these yoga pants\n",
      "Very comfortable - material is nice\n",
      "Wow. Love these. Soft, good amount of stretch and squat proof! Waist band comes up high and stays in place. Purchased bc of a YouTube review I watched and am very pleased. They last through my crossfit wod and look good when I go to the grocery after.\n",
      "Love the feel of the fabric but they run way too small.\n",
      "These are AMAZING. The fit is fantastic. They do not show anything when bending over. Love,love them. Four pair for the price of one Lucy pair.\n",
      "These leggings are so comfortable! I put they fit somewhat large because of how stretchy they are. They are perfect for hiding the muffin top unlike other leggings in the same size. They also have a small hidden pocket that is perfect for holding keys!\n",
      "Love these leggings - nice thick material (not see through) and the length is perfection. I am 5'7&#34; about 145 lbs and ordered the medium. They come up just below my belly button, which I love for it's love handle cinching quality.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE these leggings! They are so comfortable and I love that they are somewhat high waisted. The material is thick and durable, not cheapy feeling at all. It goes on nice and smooth and isn't sheer or see through.  I worked out in them the other day and there was no problem, no sweat, it felt great.  I will absolutely most definitely, positively be purchasing more of these again and again!  I want to try the high waisted tummy control, I love high waisted leggings.\n",
      "Beautiful color!\n",
      "I have found that their sizing in general has changed a bit. Runs a little smaller than before. Fabric contents may have something to do with this change?  I have in fact even lost some weight so I'm sure that they are running smaller than previous purchases.\n",
      "These are my favorite leggings. Nice and thick and have great stretch\n",
      "These are my all time favorite workout pants. I am 5'7&#34; and I have a hard time finding crop pants that are not almost at my knees. These are more like ankle length or slightly above and I love them. Bought 5 pairs.\n",
      "I love these.  The material is great.\n",
      "These are the best capris ever!!!  They are so compfy and they look awesome on me!!!  I ordered two pairs on accident but I'm not even returning them because I'll wear them so much I my as well keep them.\n",
      "I was hesitant to try Yoga pants for exercise, but they are great.  since I have worn mine, several other women in my group are wearing yoga pants too.  The 90 degree is perfect, comfortable, looks great.  Can't say enough good about them.  I did read the reviews and ordered XL instead of L and they are a good fit.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE PANTS! Fits true to size for reference I'm 5'2 125 lbs and got a small. I've spent hundreds on designer workout pants and after these I'm never going back! Really great colors that stay true even after washing!\n",
      "Very comfy yoga pants with great style! Great price too!\n",
      "Perfect fit! Love them!\n",
      "Love it. I will buy another one soon.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "I returned them. Too small\n",
      "Just like the pair I bought in a Department store. It' even has the same Item Number. I was surprised!  🤗\n",
      "Did not like the quality or the fit. Gave me an awful muffin top! Spent the extra money and bought a pair from Zella. Worth every penny!!\n",
      "Love these yoga pants. They don't roll down and fit great. They also wash well. I want more colors now. I have black and gray but will be adding to my yoga wardrobe.\n",
      "Extremely comfortable, durable, and wonderful! I am so thankful that I found awesome workout pants that I was able to buy in every color of the rainbow because they were so affordable!!!\n",
      "Nice light weight flexible comfortable yoga pants. It's hard to find yoga pants that don't feel heavy and hot. It's hard for me to workout in uncomfortable clothing. Also bought the tops to match.\n",
      "I absolutely love these, Great colors and quality for the price.\n",
      "A little lighter than pictured, but otherwise a great pair of workout pants! Love 90 Degree, their active wear never disappoints.\n",
      "Love them, color is great and super comfy!\n",
      "Love these! Such a great price, comfortable, and the perfect length!\n",
      "Product is alright, first time I wore them the strings already started coming undone.\n",
      "I love these leggings! I ordered the &#34;purple impressions&#34; color, although they don't really look purple, they look much more blue than purple (see picture) I still love the color. They are very comfortable, and not see-through which is a major plus. I would definitely ordered these in other colors :)\n",
      "These pants are AMAZING!! So comfy and flexable! I can't wait to order more in every color\n",
      "Love the fit of these the heather charcoal changes color with swear but I still like the color.\n",
      "Very comfortable and a great fit. However, the black ones (made with 87% nylon) ARE SEE THROUGH. They do not pass the deadlift/squat test :) - trust me - but they would work for running/cardio/etc - just wouldn't recommend for leg day. The other pair I have - bright pink -- VERY hot pink - is made with more polyester and those are not see through. Hope that helps!\n",
      "the coral color seems to fit differently, maybe it's just the color is rather unflattering on me (i.e. cellulite central which isn't generally visible) when the other colors have been much more flattering.\n",
      "Material is great, might show a little cellulite if you have lots.\n",
      "I have been searching for the perfect pair of capris that are long enough where they won't ride up my legs and end up bunched at the knees. I'm a tall person. These are amazing and I will be buying more!! Comfortable, soft and not see through.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Love it.\n",
      "I wear a size 8 and I got a medium. They were too snug for my comfort and fit more like compression pants. I'll go up a size so I can wear them for yoga but won't feel like I'm on display if I have to run to the store in them.\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "They don't cut into your lady bits (no camel toe)\n",
      "They are thick and well made\n",
      "Provide support (if you want them tight)\n",
      "Priced right\n",
      "Cons\n",
      "They are too snug for yoga and every day wear.\n",
      "I can feel the horizontal seam in the crotch area (hoping this will be remedied with a larger size)\n",
      "you van see threw them\n",
      "I am 5'2. 132lbs. Usually a size small.\n",
      "My Purchase: color Sage - small\n",
      "I've had a pair of their leggings from Marshalls. This is my first purchase of their capris. I've worn these multiple times so I could give a more accurate review from my experience. I wash machine them in cold water & put them in the dryer.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "-Comfy fit & buttery feel\n",
      "-Doesn't suffocate\n",
      "-Not see through (did bent over test - could be because it's a bit loose on me, so the material isn't super stretched)\n",
      "-Keeps you cool through workout\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "-Not true to size for me (bit loose). Had to pull them up a few times while working out.\n",
      "-Due to the stitching down the crotch - beware of camel toe!\n",
      "-Crotch area fits a bit loose\n",
      "-Sweat stain (dries up quickly) doesn't bother me though\n",
      "All in all, I kept this pair. Still love it. Will purchase XS next order. Would highly recommend others to give it a go!\n",
      "These are sooooo comfortable and I love that they sit slightly high on my hips and hide my mommy tummy. Plus they're 'squat proof' (not see through), super soft, and don't make you overheat at the gym.\n",
      "Perfect, currently my favorite pair of leggings\n",
      "love the color and is very comfortable and supports perfectly!\n",
      "I bought these to wear on vacation with skirts and over-sized shirt. I am 5' 6&#34;, 125 lbs, I got a small and they fit snug/comfy. They are a bit more athletic (slight sheen) than I expected, but they are super comfortable and have a tiny change pocket hidden in front. Also, a long t-shirt or cotton dress slides nicely over them when I walk, which is nice.\n",
      "These leggings are so soft and the sage color is really nice.\n",
      "I really like the fit of these yoga pants. The material is soft and comfortable with just a little compression. This is my second pair. The only reason I didn't make it 5 stars is that the color was not as expected. I ordered &#34;lavender grey&#34; and expected, based on the product photos, for it to be a darker grey with just a tint of purple, but these are basically light lilac.\n",
      "Good quality and fit.  No roll down or up of the waistband during yoga sessions.  Very comfortable. Have already ordered a 2nd pair.\n",
      "Love the quality and price of these leggings!! You won't be disappointed! There's even a hidden pocket for your phone/cash.\n",
      "If you're short like me (5'3&#34;), you'll probably have to roll them up at the bottom. They're cropped but they fit awkwardly on my calf. Not bad at all for the price.\n",
      "absolutely love them but i will be getting x small next time. a must buy.\n",
      "Very nice high quality product. Washes well. Feels great.\n",
      "Love! Great material\n",
      "Impressed... As a LuluLemon lover.  These pants are comfortable, high waisted, seem to be a great material.\n",
      "Really comfortable and fits well!\n",
      "The leggings are more high-waisted than in the photo but the fit is good, my wife is 5' 2&#34;, 130lbs & the small fits her well.\n",
      "90 Degree make the BEST workout pants. Own probably 4 different pairs of pants by this company. I purchased the magenta color this time to add to my collection. I love these pants because they are soft, comfortable, breathable, fitted just right to accent my features and the best part is they are thick and NOT see through!! I wear these for all of my different work out classes and they are great. I wash them in cold and hang dry, they last a long time and don't fade. I am 5'9, around 150 and can wear a medium or large. I got a large in these.\n",
      "These were great -- the small was a tiny bit snug but not really a problem. I'm 5'5&#34; and these were just a little longer than pictured, but I'm used to my pants being kind of long because models are usually several inches taller than me. I just scrunched them up a bit at the ankle to look more like capris. The length actually makes them very versatile because they can seem like regular length leggings or capris on someone my height depending on how you wear them. The material was nice and thick while still being breathable. I've washed them a couple of times and they still look new. Overall I'm very impressed by this brand and the quality of their products for such a low price!\n",
      "These are literally the perfect pants. If your weight fluctuates, these pants always fit and look good. I live in these!!!\n",
      "I love this company, soft, fits true to size, beautiful colors and lasts all my crazy workouts!\n",
      "I love these yoga pants, they fit great,feel good,  they are not see through.  I have them now in 2 colors and plan to get a few more colors.  I would definetly recommend these !\n",
      "I bought these a side larger since I already owned a pair from TJMax and love them. I was happy to find another pair on Amozon.\n",
      "I have about 5 pair of these pants. They fit great and are a really good quality. They don't roll down, they stay put and don't restrict movement in any way. Also I am really short so it's hard to find pants that don't bunch up at the ankle, I find these work great as full length for me.\n",
      "Perfectly fitting, comfortable, and opaque everyday leggings for wearing constantly. I will be ordering again!\n",
      "My wife loves them. Super soft and comfy. Fits good.\n",
      "Good value. Launder nicely. thick enough to conceal under garment. Wish they came in white and maybe a little shorter (the reason for the 4 STARS). Very satisfied with the quality and wearability. My go to brand...will order again.\n",
      "This brand has turned into my favorite brand of leggings. I can put them in the wash and dryer and they're still holding up....color, stretch, and all.\n",
      "These Capri's will draw a lot of attention because the color is so bright. I ordered XS because I like them to stay up on my waist, I typically wear a size 4 so I can also go up in size to a small if I want to but for some reasons the smalls don't really stay up as I like them to.  Very stretchable a not see through at all.... you will love them!\n",
      "I wanted to keep these so bad! They seem great quality and fit great everywhere except the waist...they ran extremely small!\n",
      "Not a whole lot to say except that these are GREAT capris pants.\n",
      "These leggings are perfect and look great on me. I bought them to wear to yoga and gym classes but they look so good I think\n",
      "I will save them for dressier occasions.\n",
      "Love these pants! They are super comfy, super stretchy and great for the gym and lounging around. They are not see through at all when you bend over which is great.\n",
      "They were a bit snug but I kind of prefer it that way as they don't move much when i work out.\n",
      "For reference, I ordered a small and I am 5'4&#34;, 130lbs and am not super thin through the thighs and hips.\n",
      "Super comfortable and the best part is it holds everything in place like my stomach! Other workout pants I've tried tend to roll down and I was constantly adjusting.\n",
      "This is my husband's account, but I bought these for myself. For the value, these pants are awesome. You can't see through them (I have $98 lulu's and you can), they have enough elastic to feel support, yet they are durable (I was constantly) and comfortable. The waist can be slightly tight but it's not too bad. I ordered 5 pairs in different colors and sizes.\n",
      "These pants are very comfy, fit as expected and I love that they offer them in ao many colors. But beware, they are see through in the back, definitely NOT gym/ squat approved and I would venture to say, probably not for that downeard dog in yoga either. If you are OK with your special parts playing peek-a-boo, then by all means buy these pants. Otherwise, these would be good for lounging around and running errands.\n",
      "perfect fit...love them !!\n",
      "Beautiful sage green and perfect fit!\n",
      "around the calves its a little large and does not hug my foot. maybe if i had gotten a smaller size it would work better\n",
      "Have bought 6-8 pairs of these leggings. Amazing! Squat proof! I'm a size 4/6 and bought mediums. Fit perfect. Will keep buying!\n",
      "I have had two pairs of these before that I had purchased at Marshalls so knew exactly how they fit and the nice quality of them.  I especially like that they have a small pocket in the waistband where you can put some money, a credit card or license, keys, etc. so you can be hands free.  They are of a good quality material that has stretch, some firmness control and no telltale see through.\n",
      "they fit fine, but the color I got was very see through! I can not speak for the other colors but the silver is transparent\n",
      "nice fit\n",
      "great product!! good tummy control! 5'7 140 medium fits perfect\n",
      "I like the color, length, and soft fabric however I wish it would be a little bit thinner.\n",
      "Absolutely love this brand of leggings. These are true squat non see through Capri! They feel so comfortable I wear them everyday even underneath my skirts and dresses.\n",
      "These capris fit very nicely.  Not a capri-wearing lady, but after recent abdominal surgery, I needed some stretchy-style pants to wear until I could fit into my regular clothes.\n",
      "These were really comfortable and the color is very versatile.\n",
      "Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars:  I ordered 2 different brands of capris, and one of them is now spamming me with email marketing messages.  DO NOT appreciate that!\n",
      "Love, love, love these pants! Absolutely a must have! I have the &#34;mom stomach&#34; and these help control it ☺️\n",
      "I love love love these capris. They are a great value, the cut is complementary, and the length is perfect (I'm 5' 6&#34;). Just the thing I need to wear with tunics and tees and sandals. They'll be perfect for fall, too, with my Converse. I ordered 3 of these and already own 4 of the longer length yoga pants from 90 Degree by Reflex.\n",
      "I really like the quality of these yoga pants but I wish they had a length option for shorter people. I'm 5'5&#34; and I ordered the cropped ones and they awkwardly end just above my ankles not at my calves like I expected.\n",
      "They fit to size, feel amazing and I look thinner lol\n",
      "Seriously they are well made and wash really good!\n",
      "Will buy MANY many more of these pants! I was contemplating busting out $100 for some lulu. However, I found these originally at TjMaxx and fell in love with them immediately. They feel like skin, but not too thin. I've worn other very thin yoga pants that showed my cellulite, but these do NOT show through at all! I am 5'3&#34; and I do have to bunch them up jussstttt a little so the ankle/calf opening isn't gaping. Sort of expected at this height though.\n",
      "Perfect fit but a little long so i roll them up twice at the bottom. I am 5'2&#34;\n",
      "Very comfortable pants! I'm 5'2 and about 135 pounds and ordered a a black in medium, though I think I could've gotten away with a small. I have thicker thighs and calves and smaller waist, which means that many tights fit me too tight around my legs. However, this isn't a problem with these! I also love that they aren't see through.\n",
      "Overall, I'd definitely recommend and am considering ordering other colors.\n",
      "Love this company! Every pair of pants that I have purchased, and I think I have 5, are amazing! Great fit! Great feel! Will definitely continue to order. Company also has amazing customer service- after receiving a defective pair, they quickly shipped out a new pair.\n",
      "I love these. They are comfy not see through. I can wear them to work out or make them casual with a cute shirt and flip flops.\n",
      "These pants are utterly amazing!!! I've bought pants for triple the cost that don't fit as well as these do! They stay up over your belly if you have one left over like me from kids! I also have bigger legs and they compress but don't cut off circulation! I am going back to buy 3 more pairs!!\n",
      "Love these!\n",
      "Fit great! Passes the bend over test. Material is thick but not heavy. I was concerned that the light color would show cellulite on the back of my legs but it camouflaged wonderfully! The color is vibrant and fun!\n",
      "This was my 5 or 6th purchase of these pants. By far my favorite. Nice material that's not too thin. Fit just right.  Great price and I always receive quickly. They keep their shape even after laundering.\n",
      "Awesome quality with very high-end feel. Fit is perfect (XL for 190 lb weight). Very complementary. Bought these to wear as a capri-layer under tropical print boutique dress but they are substantial enough to wear as exercise tights without it looking tacky.  Looks fantastic!\n",
      "Bought these to match a specific workout top and while the color is nice, the fit and material aren't particularly flattering, and what's worse is they show every drop of sweat... even in the knees (yeah, who knew knees sweat?!) but the crotch area was particularly mortifying. These might be fine for yoga but wouldn't recommend for anything more sweaty or strenuous than that.\n",
      "Love these so much!\n",
      "I'm very athletic, with a smaller than normal waist due to my weight lifting & high levels of cardio, so they fit a little large around the waist!\n",
      "If you an average body, then these pants would probably fit perfectly\n",
      "Product was exactly as described, fit great, & was the perfect length\n",
      "Love these! I was looking for pink yoga pants- I actually bought these AND a pair from lululemon the same week... and I like these better!!\n",
      "The best darn deal for capris I have yet to discover.  They fit like a dream!  Medium is a medium.  The crotch behaves as one would hope as in no creeping up anywhere it should not.\n",
      "I tried on SO many pairs of work out pants and could not find any that fit the way I needed them to. I figured I would give these a try and they are amazing! The high waist gives acts as a control top and the fabric does not cut into my crotch in an unappealing way. Sorry for that visual but it is a real problem when it comes to these types of pants. I am very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "I LOVE these yoga pants.  I have a collection! BEST exercise pants I've found!\n",
      "New favorite pair of leggings! I've already ordered them in 3 different colors. I love the way they feel on and they are very flattering. Absolutely love!!!\n",
      "So comfy and such a great price!!\n",
      "Great quality but too big for me.\n",
      "Love these capri leggings.  Great fit.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE. most comfortable leggings EVER.  I'm buying 2 more pair!\n",
      "They are not tight around the calves/ankle, and have weird creases in odd places that don't go away which makes these look cheap. I love the sage color, but the fit is weird around the lower leg. Wish the sage color came in full length.\n",
      "These are my favorite Capri yoga pants. I've bought 2 pairs of them and I wear them all the time. I'm 4'10 so they fit more like a crop pant than a Capri but either way I still love them!\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Squat proof! love the color\n",
      "So comfortable! I am definitely going to be ordering some more in different colors!\n",
      "Love, love, love these workout capris!  Will buy more.  Absorbed the sweat real well, fit perfectly.  Comfortable.\n",
      "Literally the best workout leggings I've ever owned. I'm 5'4&#34; so they fit almost like a 7/8 legging. So comfortable and lightweight but not see-through.\n",
      "Love these leggings. Comparable to some other expensive brands at a quarter of the price.\n",
      "Love them they do have a little stretch so if you like em tight I think you can get away with a smaller size than usual\n",
      "Great value.  Holds up well after multiple washings ( in an old crappy machine)\n",
      "great pants\n",
      "They're ok. Not as great as I expected but would buy again. Equivalent to Old Navy capris\n",
      "I'm so happy I found these online! I'm 5'4&#34; and 150 lbs., size 8 but I ordered a size large. I think a medium might have been a better choice but I'm still very happy with these. I don't have &#34;cricket legs&#34; (chubby thighs rubbing together) and so far I haven't noted any pilling anywhere.  The colors are gorgeous, the material is cool and breathes even though it compresses nicely and holds everything where it should be. I'm a little bit overweight (I refuse to say curvy, because curvy to me is just a delicate way of saying I'm fat). I've been toning up and have been developing some decent muscle tone. I'm losing weight so will be back for more of these amazing capris later when I'm down another size!\n",
      "I love these yoga capris. I like that they have a slightly higher waist, they are extremely comfortable and fit perfectly.  I bought them in 3 colors.\n",
      "Great pants. Stretchy material.  They're not too tight and I can work out in them.  Running or squats aren't a problem.  The back stays in place and doesn't show off what color my undies are.\n",
      "Wow I love these pants! They are a nice, thick (not too thick, but substantial) material with a good amount of elasticity so they fit well and are super comfy. I bought them for the gym but wore them to work under a tunic because I couldn't wait to wear them. The material is thick and not at all see-through. I haven't washed them yet, so I can't say if they'll pill, but right now I'm very happy with them - I ordered two more pair...\n",
      "Fits very well and seems durable.\n",
      "These are great! I was so sick of buying capris that would ride up my calves and constantly need to be pulled down. I really love the length on these. I am 5'6 and they hit about 4 inches above my ankles, which is perfect. I've bought 3 pairs already (2 black, 1 spring navy) and I keep checking to see when charcoal will be available again in my size. All of aspects of the fit (the waist size, the stretch, etc) are also great. I highly recommend these!\n",
      "Overall fit as expected, but the legs are long for me to be Capri. I'm 5'3&#34; and they almost come to my ankles. High yoga waist was comfy.\n",
      "Oh my god. These leggings are AMAZING! They feel so buttery and smooth! I was a little bit worried about the sizing. I was torn between getting a medium or a large, but decided to go with the medium (if they were too small I figured I would use them as motivation haha). I wear a medium in Old Navy/Target leggings and these were actually a little loose in the waist. So glad I got the medium. For reference, I am 5'7 and weigh 165 lbs.\n",
      "I am not someone who feels the need to spend more than about $60 on workout leggings. But these are just as good as high end ones on the market.\n",
      "I'm currently sitting here deciding if I should buy all of them right now...\n",
      "I was skeptical when ordering these capris, simply because of the price. I have stuck with bigger athletic brands for leggings since I've never had a poor experience, but wanted to find comfortable, flattering and quality alternative to $50+ a pair. These are exactly what I needed. They are soft and breathable, but thick enough to conceal underwear lines. I will be ordering more!\n",
      "These are the best leggings!\n",
      "These are my favorite pair of yoga pants.  In fact, I've already purchased more!\n",
      "Love the control for the belly.  Good quality for the price!\n",
      "I have heard great things about 90 Degree yoga capris, but these were not for me. I ordered a size up based on reviews. They are incredibly comfortable and fit perfectly, but totally see through. I would think they would be great for everyday wear, but not exercise.\n",
      "These workout Capri leggings are amazing! I got the mango flame and they are the colored that is pictured. As for sizing I weigh 171lbs and I got a medium, it's fits perfect! They are comfy and super cute!\n",
      "I have these pants in blacknin a size small and the black size fits perfectly. These blue ones seem a tad big  I hope they don't stretch. They are very nice quality and thick and there is no show through and I love that! I am 5'6&#34; and 130 lbs athletic build and I wear a size small.\n",
      "I will never wear another brand of legging- these are perfect length (5'6&#34;), thickness, and texture.  Smoothes with no lines or show through.  I have 5 pairs and will purchase more.\n",
      "LOVE IT!!!\n",
      "Best leggings I've ever worn! They move with you but don't get loose during the day. I am 145 pounds 5'4 and the mediums are perfect fit. They stay true black too no fading!\n",
      "Great workout and yoga pants.  Fabric not too thin. May be somewhat larger than expected, but would purchase again.\n",
      "These are amazing! They're so comfy, not see through, fit awesome and GREAT quality! I'll definitely be buying another pair for sure!!\n",
      "These are the perfect capris, seriously. If you want them to be more &#34;tummy trimming&#34; order a size down.  The size you would generally wear will be comfortable, but not have the slimming.  I have purchased four pairs in two weeks, because I love them!\n",
      "I am a pear-shaped woman and these capris cover well.\n",
      "SO buttery soft!  The navy color is JUST what I have been searching for.  Nice compression around the belly helps pull everything in.\n",
      "Awesome color, awesome fit, great quality!\n",
      "These are my new favorite pants!! Wow they fit perfectly and so comfortable!! Excellent quality. Will be buying more of these!! I'm 130lbs and 5'3&#34; and ordered a small.\n",
      "I absolutely love this brand of yoga pants. I have 2 pairs and plan on buying more. They are a tad bigger than I thought they would be. But I think that's because I've lost weight and just got the size I usually get. I'm 5'3&#34; & 137lbs and the medium fits great, just a little loose in the crotch and waist area. Not enough to make my runs/walks uncomfortable. I will order a small next and add to this review. I hope this helps!\n",
      "These are great pants for the price. Fit is nice and they are well made.\n",
      "Love these!\n",
      "I might return these for a bigger size... I ordered these and the high waist full length ones (in black) in the same size. The other ones fit great, but these are a bit more see through than I'd like.\n",
      "I like these pants and they fit perfect however they took 10 whole days to get here.\n",
      "Nice and snug. Good fit. True to size. I ordered a small. I'm 5'1&#34; and 120. Comfortable for me to dance in and love the hidden pocket.\n",
      "The fabric is a little rough and offers less elasticity than expected.\n",
      "Best.Yoga. Pants. Ever!\n",
      "I've had these pants for like 3 years now and I LOVE them. They are great, and I plan on buying more from this brand!!\n",
      "Frankly the best workout wear I own\n",
      "These pants a awesome! They feel great on and are pretty close to sizes of any normal yoga pants. These are great because you can't see through them like many of the other yoga pants out there. Also, I find that they make your tummy look flatter and your butt looks nice too :).\n",
      "The company makes the best workout pants! Absolutely love them! They are comfortable, sit just right and don't fall down.\n",
      "Don't suggest this color for a lot of cardio though!\n",
      "I like them, but I bought them thinking that they would be a shorter version of the full length pair that I love...they aren't.\n",
      "good\n",
      "Shorter than I anticipated, more of a crop/capri but the fabric is so soft and comfortable, they sit high enough on the waist that they don't fall down when exercising, not see through and I love the sage color\n",
      "Love these! Great fit and great color\n",
      "These are one of the best yoga pants you will find. I have three pairs total and they are so well made and not see through at all. I highly recommend these!\n",
      "best yoga pants ever worn,sexy and comfortable,the yoga man.\n",
      "Fit perfectly. compression was not too much and they're opaque.  great\n",
      "Fit great.  May be see-through if a tighter fit.\n",
      "I really like these yoga pants and have them in several colors. However, after only a month, there is a hole in the crotch area.\n",
      "Love the fit and color!\n",
      "Fits perfect!! Holds in stomach and flattering on your peaches 🍑\n",
      "They fit as expected and are very comfortable. I recently started going to yoga classes and these are perfect. They are a bit heavier than others I looked at but I wanted something a bit heavier. They are very well made and I feel they will hold up well to many washings.\n",
      "I'm so pleased with this purchase!  I love the brilliant colors, which are true to the image on the screen, but even prettier in person.  The size seems totally as expected, if not a little cozier and stretchier than most yoga capris.  Love these so much!!!\n",
      "the most comfortable leggings! And they aren't see through.  I also have the regular length.  Plan to order more.\n",
      "Love them! No cellulite shows thru. And I'm pretty sure that I look thinner in them.  (Yippee!). They stay in place in exercise classes without having to adjust even once.  I would definitely buy again\n",
      "Waistband is very loose and the pants keep falling off, after first day of wearing it!\n",
      "LOVE THEM - PERIOD.\n",
      "I am a big fan of 90 Degree By Reflex tights, and have several pairs: they're well made, and they fit and wash well (I hang them to dry).\n",
      "I love these pants! The color is so vibrant and I love the fit. I ordered them in black and honey rose. However, after only 3 washes (just over one month), the material on the back side of the honey rose began to wear and I can see the fabric thinning out near the seam. Unfortunately, I missed the return window (May 15th), but how was I to know the pants would wear that quickly? Now I'm wondering if the same thing is going to happen to the black pair. I don't want to return, but I would love a replacement. Kinda bummed right now.\n",
      "Grass paints highly recommend\n",
      "They were longer than i wanted.\n",
      "Love these for working out. Small fits perfectly for a size 4-6. Nice and thick so they are not see through without being hot.\n",
      "good quality!  I am 5'2 125 lbs and a small fits great.\n",
      "I have a couple of pairs of these in a large and fit perfectly. I ordered a large here and it was a size small. I do love these workout pants so I will purchase another order in XL.\n",
      "Came little bit smaller then expected.\n",
      "I love how the heather colors fit. These pants are very comfortable for lounging and also working out.\n",
      "Runs small IMO. Ordered medium based on other reviews, and it was uncomfortable tight. I normally wear 8-10 in pants, and am a fairly fit individual with a white girl booty. (5'9&#34; tall, 145 lbs)\n",
      "Fit very nicely. I am short so capris usually end up being like pants on me but not with these. Come perfectly to mid calf.\n",
      "Althought the material is SUPER comfortable, the black pair is see through. I did get the lavender gray pair and I don't experience this issue. So I do recommend these leggings just not the black pair.\n",
      "So comfy and smooth, perfect length to tuck into boots or wear with sneakers. I love these!\n",
      "Quality product. True to vibrant color as seen online.  Fabric is soft, silky & lightweight, while smoothing one's silhouette comfortably. I am 5'7&#34;, 153 lbs :-( , & Large fit's perfectly. Certainly recommend.\n",
      "LOVE THESE! Just purchased 2 more this morning.\n",
      "I ordered 2 black and 1 teal pair back in November 2016 and absolutely loved these. Used them to work out in, casual lounging at home, yard work. Loved them so much that I wanted to buy more so I bought 4 more black pairs late March 1017 and they felt different..and not in a good way. They were a thinner material. My first pair were thicker and not see trough if I bent over, this new material being used is see through... definitely disappointed. I will be looking for new yoga pants. Disappointed!!!\n",
      "Very good material\n",
      "Love them. I'm a size 1 in Juniors and I got the XS. They fit me perfectly. Such a vibrant color too!\n",
      "They aren't the grey color as shown, more of a greenish grey. Not the prettiest color. The fit is as expected but the color sucks.\n",
      "These are ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! I am 5'3 120lbs and got small in 3 different colors. They fit snug up top and wont fall down (but are comfortable, dont cut into you) They are smooth fitting on your booty, doesn't flatten you out cause they have plenty stretch. So comfy and the colors are beautiful!\n",
      "I'm new to the yoga pants craze. Decided to jump in and try these and am really happy I did. The material is very soft and there is a good color selection. I ordered the sage and the spring navy first to see if I liked them. Loved them so I placed another order for the lavender grey and the mango flame. Please note that the picture of the lavender grey is not correct. They are showing a slightly darker grey but the actual color when received is much darker and has more of a lavender hue, but this is what I was hoping for.\n",
      "Comfy, fitted, flexible yoga pants. Decent quality and soft. Mild compression.\n",
      "I just came back to order these in black. These are amazing! No see through! Tight on the tummy. No roll over! I am very very pleased with my purchase! I will come back again and again.\n",
      "Not like the photo, boxy and large\n",
      "Comfortable and stylish for dressing up or working out at gym ! I am 5'7 at 151 lbs I usually wear a medium and they fit true to size, won't slide down. . Love love love! Purchased heather gray fit perfect in medium-purchased black and they were a bit snug. A definite size difference in black I will be ordering a large.\n",
      "Great color and great fit!\n",
      "I am in love with these leggings!\n",
      "So comfortable! Can wear all day, great for walks too.\n",
      "Love these for working out.  They stay in place through squats, jumps, and running, and aren't too hot!\n",
      "These yoga capris are the BEST.  They're so well priced and well constructed. Some yoga pants are so thin that they're just short of transparent. These are heavy enough in weight that there's no issue w/ them being see through but not so heavy that they'd be overly hot. They fit great and they have a little hidden pocket for maybe a driver's licence and 1 credit card. LUCKILY I bought these in 3 or 4 colors. They're great. I'm on my way to a spa for 2 weeks and these are going to be my main items of apparel. Perfect for the gym, but substantial enough and cute enough that they work great OUT of the gym.\n",
      "I love these pants.  They are comfortable and great quality.\n",
      "Thes pants are a perfect fit. They are soft and comfortable. I also have long pants that fit perfectly.\n",
      "Great quality!  Girlfriend loves them and approves her new yoga pants.\n",
      "Very cute. Very comfy. Great color!\n",
      "Talk about a drop crouch! These things were WAY too big in the waist and fell off of me.\n",
      "Fits pretty well but is a little loose around my calves. The sea green and jade colors only have a slight difference visually. Sea green being slightly lighter.\n",
      "True to size, pretty color (true to image) and wide waist band tames ye old muffin top.\n",
      "I'm 5'3&#34; and 125. The Fit was great, However, I bought 2 pair for work and they didn't even last 6 months before getting holes in the material.  Good while they lasted, but ultimately a waste of money.\n",
      "It def does cover the tummy but NO WAY you can squat in these! THESE ARE DEF SEE THROUGH when you squat or bend over :(  I haven't worn them outside yet cuz I am afraid in the sun you can see through.\n",
      "Excellent quality, true-to-size fit, SUPER comfortable!  I plan to wear them as leggings cuz I love the length.\n",
      "I'm going to buy more of these!\n",
      "These are awesome! Good quality, not see-through like a lot of black leggings can be. I'm 5'2&#34; and 135lbs and wear a medium...legs are a tiny bit long when stretched all the way out, but easy to pull them up a little so they sit where I want them to. Very comfortable and not hot/heavy. Great purchase!\n",
      "solid, comfy leggings. no see through, and nice compression without being too tight\n",
      "These are very comfy and quality.\n",
      "Loved these. So comfortable\n",
      "They're not as high rise as they look in the picture by the quality is very nice. They are thick and very comfortable.\n",
      "These leggings are very comfortable and when you run they stay in place and don't fall down. I am 5'2 and where a Large in pants. The bottoms flare out on the calf. Not really made for short people.\n",
      "After trying all brand names found perfect fit for every occasion. Well made, bought 3 colors, will buy all. Great\n",
      "I've bought quite a few pairs of yoga pants and I was disappointed that these were too big and you can see your panties through them:(\n",
      "Love them! They fit great and so comfortable! My go to work out pants! They wash well too! Will be ordering more.\n",
      "Fit really well and don't move around when doing yoga, cycling, or other workouts. First tried these at TJMaxx and they fit so well I bought 3 more on Amazon. Best fit and super comfortable for amazing price. Highly recommend these pants, especially if you've been paying much more for a less than ideal fit!\n",
      "I love these! I found them in a store (tjmax ithink).  I lived in them while gardening that week.  I looked the brand up on Amazon and ordered another.  They're really comfortable and will definitely purchase more as needed.\n",
      "Working out 6 days a week I have alot of spandex. These are by far the best. Soft, stretchy, not see through and the perfect fit and length!\n",
      "Great pants. Don't make me write more words than I want to Amazon as I don't have the time to do that.\n",
      "This is my favorite brand of workout leggings! They fit perfect & are not see thru at all (which can be an issue for women with larger butts & hips like myself). I have them in 3 different colors so far & definitely plan on purchasing more!\n",
      "These pants are absolutely amazing and fit perfectly. I have bought 2 pair now and would highly recommend. Great material!\n",
      "These capris are great quality and priced right. They are very comfortable and fit great. Easy care and machine washable.\n",
      "These pants are semi see-through. Did not pass the gym test. Cute color though. I got the pink. Not bad for the price.\n",
      "The fit for these pants is very comfortable, I was disappointed that they were slightly see through. Not bad enough to send them back, just enough to make me aware of when I wear them. As a yoga instructor and personal trainer it's very important for me to not have see through pants, so I will be careful not to wear these when I am teaching or doing leg day.\n",
      "Meh. I guess I just don't understand all the great reviews about these. I found the fabric to be a bit scratchy, not quite enough compression for my liking, and see through in the butt when squatting. I normally take a Medium in leggings so that's what I ordered, but found them to run just a bit large--but that could be because I was expecting a little more compression. I missed the return window (my own fault), so I'll wear them around the house, but not to the gym.\n",
      "Fantastic, fit and very comfortable\n",
      "My favorite pair of leggings that just so happen to also be the cheapest!  Great buy.  thick, sturdy material that doesn't fall down my butt when i'm at the gym.\n",
      "5-3&#34;, 105 and the xs fits perfect.  Love these leggings, have worn them hiking, to the climbing gym and even to work with a tunic blouse with tennis shoes, flip flops and boots.  The waist is comfortable, no digging  or rolling,  they wash and dry great with no shrinkage and they're a medium weight with no see through.  Definitely recommend this product.\n",
      "Great leggings!  So comfortable! The quality is right up there with, if not better, than the expensive brands. I am 5'5 /120 lbs. I ordered a small and they are perfect!\n",
      "Bwtrwr than lulu\n",
      "Love these ! Fit, length and fabric all perfect !\n",
      "It fits very well and is very comfortable.  Highly recommend for Pilate and daily use.\n",
      "Just got these in the mail yesterday, wore them today and I'm very pleased with these.  Very soft and extremely comfortable.  I'm 5'6&#34; and 113# and got the XS, which is what I normally would get for workout leggings so they're sized well.  They're very flattering and seem high quality overall, especially for the price.  They're snug in all the right places, and offer a good amount of compression to keep things looking smooth, but without them *feeling* overly tight and constrictive like my running pants do.  Not sure how well they will hold up, will try to do an update in a few weeks/months...but for day one, I'm fairly impressed.\n",
      "This is my wife's second pair of yoga capris pants, one black and one navy blue.  She is 5'3'' so they are on the long side for capris and short for full length, just right for yoga!\n",
      "Love these!!! Originally ordered medium which was too big (I'm 5'9 145lbs with a good size booty) and exchanged them for a small which is perfect! Nice and stretching, not see-thru at all, and that color is amazing! I have received tons of compliments and no one can believe that they aren't lululemon\n",
      "I sent these back right away---I bought them based on the glowing reviews, but they did not work for me.  They were unattractive, and didn't streamline my body, AND there's no way they can pass for everyday regular leggings, because they have that distinct synthetic sheen.  I'm glad they work for some people, but to me, they noticeably look like activewear, rather than leggings you could wear with a blazer or sweater.\n",
      "Also....the ankles were huge.  I wish I'd taken a photo before I returned them, because they stuck out from my normal-sized ankles by more than an inch.  Admittedly, I DID overshoot on size a little.  I am 5'6&#34;, average build, and normally wear a US Women's Medium, but I wanted to be comfortable, so I ordered a Large in these leggings, and they're just too frumpy dumpy.  But even if I'd gone down a size, these leggings were too much of an activewear style to work for me.  The fabric is thick, but it doesn't hold you in enough (like Zella leggings that I get at Nordstrom) and the synthetic sheen is just too unappealing to work with the rest of my wardrobe.\n",
      "I noticed black leggings are more loose than grey ones. If they can have the same size it would be lovely. Otherwise I liked the capris a lot.\n",
      "Awesome fit, don't slide down and aren't see through.\n",
      "Fits as expected. Not see through AT ALL! So comfy. Also, what was important for me was that the waistband didn't cinch too much! Definitely will buy again\n",
      "Love these!\n",
      "These are amazing, top-notch quality, and a beautiful magenta.  Sadly, they are way too big.  90 degrees: PLEASE make XXS!!!  For reference, I am 5&#34;1 and 85 lbs (slim/athletic) and these were loose on the thighs and crotch, making them unflattering. Totally recommend these for anyone looking for high quality workout clothes without the fluff branding.\n",
      "Material is a good thickness and fit well.  I am 5'6&#34; and weigh 120 and got the medium.  They are loose in the waist so I probably should have gotten a small but it's not bad enough to exchange them.  They are cute.\n",
      "These are my go to workout pants. So incredibly comfortable and the fit is fantastic!! I would HIGHLY recommended them!! I plan to get every color in time!\n",
      "Love this brand, never disappoints\n",
      "Good quality but runs a bit small\n",
      "They fit a little small. And show every line and imperfections in your body. Even wearing a thong, you can see underwear lines very well..\n",
      "If you can't afford Lululemon to save your life (ME!), these leggings are the peffect alternative.\n",
      "However, they run a bit big. They may look small when you pull them out of the package but believe me. They are meant to open up and hug in all the GOOD ways.\n",
      "I originally purchased a small. Then I ordered an XSmall. They fit absolutely PERFECT! I am 5'6&#34; and 130 lbs, pretty muscular as I am a practoicing yogi and yoga instructor. These leggings are my favorite. I will be exclusively buying leggings from 90 Degree by Reflex\n",
      "This is my fourth pair of these leggings and I just can't say anything negative about them. They arrive quickly. Fit as expected. For the price I wouldn't expect such great quality, but they are!\n",
      "Love these Capri pants!  I have about 7 pairs of them and have been wearing them for about 2 years.  Some of them have stretched out now since it's been 2 years, but I still love them.  The fabric is great, I don't like wearing cotton fabric to workout in.\n",
      "They're a little tight on my waist, but fit good every where else.  I'm 5' 3&#34; and 125lbs.\n",
      "My FAVRORITE yoga capris!  Seriously...these are the best!  And...this royal blue color....looks amazing in person.  I get all kinds of compliments!\n",
      "Love these! Thick material, very comfortable. Love this company!\n",
      "Great product!! Wore them in my first 5k and they were super comfortable and supportive!! Great material!!\n",
      "These are my new go to for capri yogas. Good compression for working out, not the most relaxed fit for lounging.\n",
      "Great leggings that don't pill or fade, fit great.\n",
      "Great item\n",
      "These are great! My new favorite workout pants.\n",
      "Fits just as expected! Feels like it's good quality material, very flattering. Has a little pocket inside the waistband for a key fob\n",
      "Only problem is the longer you wear them, the looser they become. Other than that the material and color is great.\n",
      "Perfect - great quality\n",
      "Love them!!\n",
      "I absolutely love these! I am 6 feet tall, 187 lbs so finding leggings long enough is always a challenge. These fit very well and have good support and compression - I wear them under everything. I am buying 2 more pair I love them so much!\n",
      "I thought they were cotton and I don't like that they are not tight fitting or slim shaping at all\n",
      "Love these! Very nice rich brown.\n",
      "Very comfortable pair of leggings. Tight enough that I know they won't fall down during a run but not too tight they're uncomfortable. Love the colors and love the fit! I ordered a size large. I'm 5'10&#34; and they come down about six inches above my ankle.\n",
      "Fits as expected.  A little rough feeling out of the package, but I'm sure it will help once I wash them.\n",
      "Super cute!\n",
      "LOVE these leggings. Just ordered 3 more! The crop leggings are definitely a better choice because they are more like ankle fit, so I know the regular length would be too long. The material is so comfortable, not see through at all, and great for work outs. I'm 5'5&#34; and 145 pounds, larger in the hip/butt area and the medium is a perfect fit. Highly recommend!\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Very thick and high quality! Also the price you pay here is less than half of what you'd pay at say Dicks or Dunham's. Love these pants. I have them in every color!\n",
      "Amazing flex fit. Super comfortable, and easy to move in. I love the high waist fit with the mid calf cut. I'm 5'4 135lbs with a curvy body and I ordered a medium, fits perfect. Also I have a white shedding dog - this material seems to have little hair that sticks to it which is a plus.\n",
      "They ate great!\n",
      "These pants fit perfect im 145 pounds, 5'8&#34; and I wear a medium. They are so comfortable and the material doesnt feel cheap so I would say these are a bargain!\n",
      "Awesome awesome awesome! Love these and would order them 100 times. Great quality, great fit\n",
      "Rode 11 hours in them home from vacation and literall felt like I wasn't wearing pants. These are the best leggings I've ever owned.\n",
      "I don't know why everyone keeps saying these aren't see through. I don't even need to try them on to tell that the second I do any type of stretching in these that you will be able to see my butt through these. I have some of the leggings that I got from tj maxx and those ones are wonderful!! These however, aren't. And they seem to be a different material.\n",
      "Really like the feel and fit of these leggings.They are nice enough to wear 'beyond' the workout! Nice fabric and comfortable waistband. I would buy these again.\n",
      "Very comfortable!!!!\n",
      "There's are amazing, especially for the price!!! I just recently started fitting into XL clothes again after being XXL for some time and this fit perfectly.  I ordered reflex blue to finally have a pair that wasn't black.  Wore them during leg day and the stretch is perfect, felt great during squats.  Definitely picking up more of these.\n",
      "I have bought several pairs of the leggings and I love them. This is first pair of capris I've bought and they're not the same material as the leggings. I bought the black pair. They're not silky like the leggings and hair sticks to them. Which sucks because I have a German Shepherd. The fit is ok, they don't seem as tight as the leggings even though I got the same size.\n",
      "These dry so fast it's scary. I leave hot yoga and after 6 minutes I am home and they are dry! Love love love them!\n",
      "I wanted to love these but I'm not a fan of the waistband. They say it's a wide waistband but there's a smaller, harder elastic band within the cloth waistband.\n",
      "this is my favorite brand of workout pants! The waist is the perfect height to hold everything in and not slide down when I'm working out.  The blue is a great bright color.  I can't say enough good things about these pants.  I will continue to buy them.  I love that they have so many fun colors and I hope that they start to add designs.\n",
      "Tried it on. Seems substantial (not see through) and well made. Have not washed it yet so I do know its longevity.\n",
      "I'm 5'8 134lbs. Bought a Small. Fits perfect. Good quality. Cannot see through these!\n",
      "These are my favorite workout paints! Bought these a couple years ago from marshalls and have been buying them since. They're $1 or $2 more on here but can't always find them in marshalls.\n",
      "Love these pants. Fit like a glove!\n",
      "I love 90 Degrees workout clothes! They really move with your body and always stay in place. The material Is thick enough to avoid any &#34;see through&#34; issues. They are my new favorite workout pants!\n",
      "Cereza is a bright and gorgeous color. Very happy with these capris that stay put during your workout. Excellent quality and durability for the price. Color doesn't fade in the wash.\n",
      "Pretty but had to return because it was too transparent.\n",
      "See through in light colors.\n",
      "Very nice\n",
      "Great work out Capri but not really comfortable for lounge wear.\n",
      "This brand has great quality stuff at an affordable price!\n",
      "Fit well.  Nice.\n",
      "One of the best pairs of leggings I have ever purchased! Very comfortable, east to wear, light weight without being shear. Also, very soft and smooth to the touch. Would highly recommend. I will be purchasing more colors!\n",
      "Fabric is nice, but gives you a mad camel-toe\n",
      "Good\n",
      "It's okay. Ordered the recommended fit but it was too big. Also it offers no compression at all.\n",
      "I have sensitive skin and my thighs were itching during the first wear.\n",
      "I love how comfortable these pants are! They are a little see through (maybe it's just the color because I have some in black and they are fine), but otherwise these are awesome!\n",
      "As all the other 5 stars--love them! 5'8 and 135 lbs and small fits perfectly!\n",
      "Love these pants! Fabric is not see through, and it has a nice soft feel, but hugs your body. So comfortable!\n",
      "Nice and thick leggings...fit great!\n",
      "Perfect length capri, I am 5'6 200lbs and they hit me about mid calf. Perfect for spring time, I loved them so much I bought a second pair in a pattern.\n",
      "These are great but I'm 5'1&#34;. I can never find crop leggings like this (just the ankle) that are actually crop on me. They fit like regular leggings. I love this brand so much though, I will probably buy all my workout leggings and maybe future active wear from them!\n",
      "Omg! These pants are awesome! They are super comfortable and soft. Not see through at all. Amazing! I will for sure be buying more!!\n",
      "The best yoga pants. They are super comfortable and not see through.\n",
      "Very comfortable would definitely recommend!\n",
      "Although these are labeled as &#34;capri's&#34; these are perfect full-length leggings on me! I'm 4'10 and it went right to my ankles, which is perfect. I'm never able to get leggings without needing to hem them, so these are such a miracle find!\n",
      "The pants themselves are super comfy and stretchy! Definitely get these!\n",
      "Very fast delivery and great quality..will look to buy more\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "I cannot give this 5 stars yet as I have only worn them twice. They fit better than I expected as I was unsure of my size. The 2 times I have worn them the pants and done beautifully, I felt great in them and bonus my husband liked them also. If these pants hold up more then these will be 5 stars for sure!\n",
      "I just ordered my 1st pair got them today ....and BAM!!!  Perfect fit and they glide right on!  So excited just ordered 2 more pair!  Gr8 colors, gr8 fabric, gr8 fit and gr8 price!  LOVE\n",
      "Love love these pants!  The fit is as expected, great control top, and very comfortable.  Did I mention they are affordable?  😀\n",
      "Perfect thanks!\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "These are one of the better running capris I've found. They stay in place without riding up or sliding down. I find them comparable to the Nike pro combat style but the material is thicker.\n",
      "Love these!\n",
      "I love these! Not only are they thick enough but they wash and dry well (I have only washed and dried them once). I think they are pretty true to size. I am a 12-14 in jeans and pants and I bought a large.\n",
      "Love these. I just replaced a pair that were worn and washed 3 times a week for a couple of years and held up well.  I have long legs so most capris hit me just below and behind the knee, which is uncomfortable for working out. The 90 Degrees are a great length and actually look and feel like capris on me.\n",
      "they are a little bit shorter than what i like and im 5 foot 2\n",
      "As pictured, length okay, but material is much heavier than the full length I purchased a week ago and the same capris I purchased a few months ago. I like the higher waistline and pocket on 90 Degree, but  the materials when buying the same exact item is not consistent. Not so much a fan of the heavier ones as they take longer to dry and weigh more to pack for backpacking.\n",
      "I love them\n",
      "I liked the way these fit and the color was very pretty .\n",
      "Love...\n",
      "So very comfortable! I've washed them a couple times and they've held up great. I was worried that they would be see through in the butt, but they aren't at all. I will definitely buy another pair soon.\n",
      "Great fit and look. Very comfortable!\n",
      "These are good quality material, I love them\n",
      "Product is well-made and comfortable with great tummy control. I would definitely buy again!\n",
      "Great purchase! Item as expected and in perfect condition.\n",
      "Good product. Not damaged, and the fabric is light but not see through. Over all I would buy more of these.\n",
      "Great fit, great coverage, no sheerness in the butt area. I'm a size 26 and ordered a small and it fit great.\n",
      "Most definitely see through. Something not apparent when you just put them on, but very see through when bent over and the fabric is stretching. I won't buy these again.\n",
      "Absolutely love the electric blue color!! These capris are stretchable and comfortable; perfect to workout in. From the picture, I was concerned that being figure-hugging, they may look obscene or the panty-line might show, but am relieved to say that neither case true because the material of the capri is not flimsy. I am a size ~2 and the S fit me well, though I think size M may have been more comfortable considering I am a bit figure-conscious.\n",
      "The waste on these were a little bit larger than I was expecting. They were falling down on my when I was running, but other exercises they were okay. They were also a thicker material than expected but that was okay for the winter months, I just won't plan on wearing these outside in the summer.\n",
      "Perfect fit.  Super comfy.  Great price.\n",
      "I liked these a lot.  Will buy more in future.\n",
      "These have become my favorite leggings! I wear them working out, and they don't fall down, not see through, and don't stretch out as I work out.\n",
      "The quality of fabric is strong, not flimsy or see-through. I do feel that they run on the smaller size. I would have returned but I'm giving to my daughter.\n",
      "Item arrived quickly and in great condition! I would argue that this product fits a littler larger than expected. I am usually a L/XL so I purchased this in a size L. I could easily size down to a M if I wanted to. Overall very good quality though! I hope to buy many more pairs -- this is a great, affordable brand!\n",
      "Fit great and opaque. High waist didn't roll down. Love them as much as Lulu!\n",
      "I will be buying more of these. Great fit, great quality, great price\n",
      "I love this brand, I fluctuate in between sizes 12-14 and these in Large work for me. I wear long tops that cover my bum since I'm aware that when I'm on the larger side it can be see thru. I don't get an XL size because I prefer the snug fit.\n",
      "Very tight and long yoga pants. Comfortable for exercise\n",
      "Fabric a little thin but works well for yoga.\n",
      "I received these and they do not work.\n",
      "I love this brand pants. I got the teal ones and i wear them to hot yoga classes. I've never noticed them being see through, even when sweaty. Plus the color is my fav. good quality. I have like 4 pairs of legging in this brand.\n",
      "Super flattering and true to color! I am 5'4 and 130 lbs and bought an xs. At first I thought they were to small around the waist but after the first use they actually stretched out and ended up fitting perfectly! i also ordered a small and although they fit great around the waist, were a bit loose on the legs (despite having big calves). Overall very happy with my purchase and will be ordering more soon!\n",
      "Absolutely love!\n",
      "I like these capris.  They are comfy!  They do show sweat so not necessarily ideal for high cardio unless you don't care.  ;)\n",
      "I just got these yesterday and they are AWESOME. They are nice and thick (but not heavy) and feel like butter. Excited that they come in a bunch of different colors - I'll probably order more later because you can't really beat the price.\n",
      "I really liked these at first but after wearing them to an intensive yoga class I could see the sweat discoloring my pants and it looked like I had peed myself. Very embarrassing. I don't know if all yoga pants that aren't black show this but I see others in the classes who don't have this problem. I got he charcoal color.\n",
      "My new favorite pants!  Soft material without being too thin.  The best part about these pants is the fit in the mid-section compared to others.  (no muffin top!)  Perfect for yoga and running.\n",
      "Love these.  Gave me a great booty pop where none exists.  Holds everything in and makes me look a lot better from behind than I actually do!\n",
      "I'm 5'3&#34; and 125 pounds. I'm in that in between size of small and medium. Bought these in a small based on other reviews and they fit perfectly. They come to about mid calf and fits right above the hip. I thought they would be too small when I first opened the package but they have a nice stretch without being see through. I would purchase these again in other colors.\n",
      "Perfect fit. I'm a size 8 pant, ordered a medium. Nice fabric. Not see through.\n",
      "I bought  small I could have ordered an XS. The sides are very itchy.\n",
      "For all of the bloggers raving they're just like Lulu leggings...not a chance. They were so stiff and came with a chemical odor. One bend or yoga pose and they were immediately see through. I returned them - there's a reason Lulu comes with a steep price tag. They're worth it!\n",
      "very nice!\n",
      "It fits great. Cannot see through when bending over and does not make you feel like sausage casing. I really like this product.\n",
      "These are my absolute favorite workout pants! Great material, not sheer, even while doing squats, so no need to worry. I own 4 different colors, love them!\n",
      "Great quality and stays put through running and pilates!\n",
      "I wish they had a petite option. The legs are a bit long but l make do. The color is more of a pastel Easter-ish green. Definitely not &#34;jade&#34;. There's a little pocket on the left front side of the pants which is convenient.\n",
      "Most comfortable non see through pants I own!\n",
      "Great quality for the price!! Washed them once so far, and they held their shape and color.  Will be repurchasing additional ones soon.\n",
      "I love these leggings. I am 5'6 and weigh 200 LBs. I am on my weight loss journey and these leggings are super comfortable and I feel great in them when I work out!! A must buy in my opinion!\n",
      "Small waste with a big butt = hard time finding yoga pants that stay up when actually doing yoga. But these stay put! Planning on buying more\n",
      "these are awesome! i've had them for months now and they have been washed several time and are holding up great! i love this brand!\n",
      "These are the best legging I have ever bought, I bought one pair off of amazon and went back and bought 3 more pairs. The quality is high. I was looking for crop leggings, theses are suppose to be mid calf but I am about 5'0, 130 pounds and they are perfect as crop leggings, just above my ankle. I ordered them in a size medium, I also work out in them very often, they do not fall down and are HIGH quality. they are not see through in anyway. the best cost and quality option around!\n",
      "LOVE 90 Degree by Reflex pants. They are comfortable, flattering, and a decent price. This is the third pair I've bought---different style every time and love them all.\n",
      "Decent fit, however the waist band rolls which is not the most comfortable. The material is nice, but a little thick. Over all a well made pair of capris for exercising in.\n",
      "I was looking for some good workout capri pants since my other ones were falling off. I wear a size 6 in jeans and I took a chance ordering the small. I'm glad I did because even though they are snug, they are not too snug to breathe, walk or workout in. The fabric is very soft and comfortable. For reference: I'm 5'2'', 134 lbs.\n",
      "I love these leggings! They do have a slightly higher rise than Lululemon or Lilly Pulitzer leggings, but that maybe why they stay up better than their much more expensive counterparts. I don't have to keep tugging at these when jogging or working out, they stay in place. I found them to be true to size. A great quality product at a very reasonable price!\n",
      "Love the fit , so comfy .\n",
      "Awesome to work out in.  Already bought 2 pairs and I'll be buying more!\n",
      "Terrible.they fall down\n",
      "These are fine, but I prefer the high waisted. I like the fit and I think the material is different as well.\n",
      "These pants are AMAZING! They fit perfectly! I almost don't want to ever take them off. The color is beautiful. Looking to buy another pair in a different color soon.\n",
      "I'm obsessed. They are thin to allow airflow but are durable. They pull up to about my bellybutton which I like for workout leggings. Definitely repurchasing.\n",
      "perfect for yoga\n",
      "Man, these pants! It's hard that I find leggings good enough to come right back and buy another pair! These are fantastic! Great quality, great stretch, great fit! Wow! Highly recommend!\n",
      "These are the best value legging on the market, seriously. I have my extended family that includes daughters, granddaughters, even friends all wearing them. I have one granddaughter that would only wear lululemon because of the quality and popularity. She moved in with me for awhile and I volunteered to do her laundry. I realized real quick they were not as durable as 90 degree. I do admit they have a large variety of styles that 90 degree doesn't offer but bottom line they do not wear as well. She now has several pair of 90 degree and loves them. Try them they do run true to size.\n",
      "Flattering, comfortable and good quality.\n",
      "I would say these are a large medium and do not run small. They are perfect for yoga and low-impact workouts, but I would size down if you're looking to run in them as they kind of slide down with high impact activity. The material is good quality and are not see through. I also love them for daily-wear! Great deal for the price. I would order these again, but get a small (5'5&#34; and ~150 lbs)\n",
      "Love them!!! Such a great deal! I'm going to order more colors\n",
      "These fit as expected and are comfortable, my wife likes them.\n",
      "I've bought 4 pairs of these  capris/pants in this brand before and have always loved them... these seem thin. The waist is not stretchy, it seemed like it was not an elastic or spandex fabric, it seems like a thin string... fine enough, hopefully I won't be in this size long.\n",
      "Love this pants. I owned them in red before, and love how they fit! I lift weights and they don't ride down when you squat down which is hard to find in a legging, unless you want to spend 80-100$ on them. I will be buying more of these in the future in every color!! :)\n",
      "Very comfortable. Perfect for my yoga classes.\n",
      "I love it as it fits me well as expected.  I would say it is a big bang for the buck.  I ordered 2nd one already.\n",
      "These capri leggings arrived quickly and fit perfectly! The look and feel was quality. I am very happy with this purchase and would buy another pair.\n",
      "These are good, not see through.  They don't stay up great when I run.\n",
      "Not the greatest​ quality, but you get what you pay for\n",
      "Order a size small and fits perfectly. (5'4 140lbs) True to their size and great quality, Im slowly ordering all different colors! Worth the price!\n",
      "Love these. They fit great with just enough spandex to hold everything in place. Also, thick enough so they are not see through but not so thick as to be uncomfortable in warmer weather.\n",
      "I have 7 or 8 pairs of these in solid and patterned and I have had them for over a year now.  I also have others that are a lot more expensive.  These are my favorites and I would recommend them to any one who is looking for quality fitness pants for a great price.  I have hiked distance, ridden my bike, done 10k's and so much more and they look like they day I got them.  I love, love, love these pants.\n",
      "Love them, will be ordering more pairs!\n",
      "Best yoga pants ever! Wore them to class and they didn't roll down.\n",
      "I have been working out at a gym for the past 3years.  I wore another kind of yoga pants until they wore out.  I thought I would have to leave the house and go shopping  to find something.  I do not like shopping and felt I was stuck in the cycle of picking out pants and them trying them on- a process I do not like that sometimes can take so much time.  So I looked on Amazon and looked at a few pairs of pants.  I read the reviews on these. decided on the size and ordered them.  That took a total of about 30 minutes.  To my surprise and great joy they fit perfectly.  They are comfortable, soft, and attractive.  I am 67 years old and just kind of wondered what I would look like in these.  I can give those young girls in the gym a run for their money in these LOL!  Seriously, I would buy these pants again and again.  Very pleased and so glad I bought these.  5 stars and beyond!!.\n",
      "Great fit and very comfortable.\n",
      "The material is high quality and I love the heather orange color. My only complaint was the mediums were way smaller than I expected. I wear medium yoga pants from Athleta and the medium 90 Degree pants gave me a camel toe and were so tight on my butt that you could see what color my underwear was. Let's hope the large is much better.\n",
      "Dont judge me but i love these pants yes i do use them very comfortable and yes would recommend this item to anyone\n",
      "love!\n",
      "These are so comfortable! Sizing was about a half size small but still fit comfortably with every wear and wash\n",
      "Extremely comfortable and great for working out. Always getting compliments at the gym about the color too!\n",
      "Love them. Thick and great quality amazing fit and vibrant color!\n",
      "absolutely perfect!  I love them, they are comfortable and solid not see thru at all.\n",
      "I never really post reviews but had to on these leggings! I'm a bodybuilder and run a fitness business so I spend a ton of my time in fitness clothes.  I've bought everything from Lululemon to Walmart cheapos.  I ordered the Jade, Black, and Heather Charcoal originally and am definitely ordering more. For the jade/teal colored pair, I got compliments all day. They're a great color!  The waist band is sturdy so I wasn't having to pull them up constantly.  The material is flexible and breathable and not see through when squatting (can I get an Amen?).  The only thing I don't love about the leggings is how wide the bottom cuff is. They're longer than most capris but not quite leggings and even with my big calves they aren't tight at the bottom like most.  I just flipped mine up to make them shorter and tighter and I think they still look great.\n",
      "The material is durable, absorbent, obpaque and very comfortable.\n",
      "I bought these pants for my wife and she wears them all the time. Fit as expected and hold up really well.\n",
      "Love these pants - will order more! They fit perfectly!\n",
      "Love these! Buying more! Don't have to keep pulling up or adjusting. Sits higher up on my waist. Looks cute on!\n",
      "These are amazing and perfect for my yoga classes.\n",
      "Love these pants! Wore them to gym class tonight! They fit like a glove! Probably going to buy more in different colors!\n",
      "Great fit.  Arrived on time.  Very satisfied.\n",
      "Great! I love it.\n",
      "Love the pocket and the comfort of these workout pants. They don't ride up or scrunch down. Fit perfect. I'm 5ft  115lb\n",
      "Bought solid black pair years ago & they have held up well. Recently purchased a new black pair & a heather chocolate pair. The heather chocolate seemed to fit more loosely than the black, not significant enough to return, but next time I'll order a size smaller in any heather colors. These pants are REALLY excellent at preventing love handles, I'm petite, but I have a booty and I am often prone to a love handle look even though I'm solid. So if you're small and you have this same issue (and people roll their eyes when you say you get love handles!) these pants are a good match for your body shape! Hope this helps!\n",
      "Very comfortable and are Squat proof.\n",
      "Absolutely love these, I have ordered 3 different pair and none are see through which is wonderful especially on leg day.\n",
      "Super comfy, soft, fit as expected. Love these leggings and will purchase again!\n",
      "I wear a small...perfect fit.  Good quality\n",
      "Bought two pair. Great material and not see through even in yoga. For reference, I bought an xs, and I'm 5 feet tall and 105 lbs.\n",
      "If you want the leggings to be tight I would size down because these are on the thinner side. For everyday running around or maybe yoga they are great for under 20$\n",
      "Perfect for the gym! Great fit. I didn't buy the high waisted ones but they still come up high enough to be comfortable!\n",
      "I've had a pair of these for over a year now, and for some reason it only just occurred to me to order a second pair. The originals have withstood 10+ camping/backpacking/climbing trips and numerous days of regular wear as well. They have stretched only a little (to my body shape) but have otherwise remained dark black and sans holes. Buy a pair of these and save yourself the $$$ on those $100 leggings. These are easily worth the money, and if you're short like me, they'll fit like regular-length leggings!!\n",
      "These are great quality for the price! The fabric is neither flimsy nor too heavy. I'm 5'2&#34;, so they're in between Capri and ankle length, for me but about what I expected.\n",
      "Really nice feel & Great price - but color is very bright! I would definitely say these are a jade color since I purchased another pair of Power flex style that are longer than these but that are also called jade. However, they are more of a teal and l prefer those. Even though the colors are both listed as jade & look the same in the descriptions they are worlds apart when you get them! So be forewarned. This pair is the lighter/brighter of the two & is more the color of a true jade stone you would find in jewelry. Both very nice just different colors people should be aware of.\n",
      "Like the color of these. I have other 90 degree e-mails and would buy these again.\n",
      "I LOVE these tights. I have them in 4 colors! Soft, not see through, they stay in place, they do not slide down at all. Love them!\n",
      "Love these. Soft . Maybe a little large , I'm  5'6 and weight 135 and the M was good but not tight. I will buy more.\n",
      "good length (mid-calf--but i'm 5'10&#34;) and super comfy. kept me from feeling like i was drowning in my own sweat after an intense spin class\n",
      "love these!\n",
      "Looks good! Nice material and not see thru!\n",
      "Very comfortable\n",
      "Fits great... better than expected. I got these for my bootcamp weightloss program. The last thing i want is to be getting my but kicked & feeling uncomfortable in what i'm wearing... (which has been my problem) these pants didn't let me down. They fit in every place...  they're comfy, strong & stretchy fabric. And they look good. I'm very pleased with these pants... i'm definitly going to order more.\n",
      "Good quality yoga pants for a reasonable cost.\n",
      "Good quality\n",
      "Thick material but lightweight with great stretch\n",
      "I bought the blue and it's a deep vibrant color\n",
      "Matte finish, not shiny\n",
      "Blue color and finish hide sweat well\n",
      "Opaque and will not show skin through\n",
      "Bought the Medium and they fit well coming up just below my belly button and hitting just below my calves. The crop is at a good spot to make my legs and ankles look slender and there's also a horizontal seam about 3&#34; below the top of the waistband that is flattering to a fuller waist - I'm 5'5&#34; and 148lbs with most of my weight at my hips and waist.\n",
      "These leggings fit well and and well made.  My only slight complaint is about the color -- they are not chocolate.  I'm not sure how to classify the color of these pants, but not quite brown.  Somewhere between brown and an off purple.  The odd color makes them hard to match to other clothing.  I can only pair these with solid black shirts.  Still nice material and good fit.\n",
      "Great price for the quality. I almost purchased another brand that was $$$$ for just one legging but the reviews, cost and pictures helped me decide on this brand. I really love these and purchased 4 colors. They are comfortable and are not see through when you bend over or squat. I'll be purchasing these in the future. Maybe if they can add a picket for a phone to improve on these leggings but I am a happy customer!\n",
      "I liked these leggings when I first got them. The fabric was on the thin side, but they weren't very see through which was my main concern. I wore these only 3 times before the seam came undone right down the middle of the butt. I was out riding a bike when it happened and had to tie a shirt around my waist just to not give everyone I passed a view of my bare butt. Horrible quality, very disappointed. Would not recommend.\n",
      "I've purchased these same leggings at Marshalls and really like them. When I found them on Amazon for a few dollars cheaper I thought I'd try them out. Only problem is the elastic stretched out in the waist the first time I put them on.\n",
      "Comfortable nice fabric fit was as I expected.\n",
      "The fit is good except I feel like I have to keep pulling up my pants when I workout. But once they are up, they fit very well.\n",
      "Very comfortable.  Like them a lot\n",
      "Absolutely love these! They stay in place and are so comfortable\n",
      "I've purchased several colors with this brand. Size is what you usually would wear in leggings, so nothing weird. They really show off your curves and they flatten all the bumps and imperfections. And they are SUPER comfortable! My favorite pants by far. They don't fade, they're not see through, and they're perfect for whatever you're doing.\n",
      "Tried them on. Not crazy about the material. I definitely prefer underarmour material. Wish I hadn't bought two of them. Considering returning them.\n",
      "These are great.... I only deducted a star bc I don't like the slight sheen the material has.\n",
      "These are flattering & smooth out problem areas.\n",
      "I got the jade green since it was cheaper-- unfortunately it is much lighter than the photo-- more like a sea foam green.  But I appreciate the length (I hate when capris ride up to my knees) as I'm tall!  Good value for $10.\n",
      "Comfortable while at the gym\n",
      "Great price and fot.  Very comfortable.  Second pai I have purchased\n",
      "So comfortable and the material is very forgiving.\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "I wanted to LOVE these leggings, but they fell short in a few ways. I am 5'3 and 137 and ordered a Medium. They fit OK- but after a few hours of wear they are baggy around the knees. The length is also kind of weird for me- they aren't tight at the bottom of the pants around my ankle/calf. They kind of flare out off my leg and in order to get them to fit tight around the bottom I have to pull them up higher on my calf. This makes the rest of the leg bunched up from the extra fabric. The worst part is the waistband!! I had a baby 4 months ago and was looking for a higher waisted legging that had a wide thick waistband for a little extra support. These pants look like they have a wide waistband, but thee really only have a 1/4 inch of SUPER tight elastic at the top of the waistband that digs in really hard and makes an obvious bulge above and below the band. Its uncomfortable and unattractive. I DO like the material of these  leggings, but they seems to attract and hold onto any kind of hair they even come close to. Carry a lint roller when you wear these!\n",
      "An XL is definitely meant for someone with a long torso and long legs not for someone that needs a little extra room around the middle. The fabric is a really thin. The elastic in the waistband feels odd, like it stretches out but won't go back to its original shape. Since there is so much &#34;extra&#34; fabric between the crouch and the top of the waistband, I have to roll it down, making it uncomfortable.\n",
      "I have this Capri, which I haven't worn yet, but like the fit, and a pair of full length which I live in. Great clothing. I did have to send back the capris with a tighter fit (blend of cotton and spandex) because they were not the easy comfort I was looking for. I like that these fit higher so there's no slipping down when I exercise and walk.\n",
      "These pants were comfortable and fit well but the color coral is see through. I returned them because any printed or colored underwear shows through the pants.\n",
      "I now have several colors of these capris, they will go with anything, are highly consistent in size, and the material is good quality.  They are only see thru in the light colors paired with loud underwear.  The jade color is actually closer to aqua and goes with any other aqua or turquoise outfits.\n",
      "One of the most comfy leggings I own! I have several. Love this brand!\n",
      "Great for the price. Perfect for Spin. Most of my leggings ride down on me when I'm working out. These fit tight and stay in place. I also like how long they are, about 2 inches longer than most other brands. I'll see how they wear with time, but they seem very durable. Will probably buy several more pairs of these. I'm a size 28 in jeans and bought a size small.\n",
      "Love these leggings, they are made of a nice fabric.  The color is  vibrant and they are  very comfortable. I like the fit  too.\n",
      "I would recommend this product\n",
      "Love them! They are so comfortable! I will be ordering more.\n",
      "Im ordering more!\n",
      "I love these.\n",
      "These are good work out leggings but I took away a star because they are see-thru when you bend over or are doing squats. I bought these in black so I don't know if the other colors are more opaque. Leggings stay in place when moving around and fabric breathes so you won't be really sweaty during intense work outs.\n",
      "returned, changes mind\n",
      "GREAT BUY\n",
      "90 Degree by Reflex is one of my favorite brands for yoga pants/capris.  This is a beautiful color I received! The 4 * is only because I was unsure what the material would be, some of the pants are a slippery smooth and some are more like cotton, I prefer that cotton likes ones which these weren't.  Still great!\n",
      "Great leggings for working out. No worrying about others seeing through them.  Look good too\n",
      "The color is perfect and they fit amazing. So breathable and comfortable. This is my second pair of this brand of leggings. Love them!\n",
      "Love these leggings. Just as pictured and fits well.\n",
      "The leggings fit perfectly and stay in place all day long. I thought they'd have more tummy control in the lower belly, this is the only aspect I am disappointed in.\n",
      "Great panst! They do not fall down at all!\n",
      "Good value.\n",
      "I got a size small. I'm 5'6&#34; about 140 and I should have ordered a medium. Not sure why I ordered a small, but they fit fine, I notice I was pulling them up a lot but that could have been because they were a tad too small. They're very comfortable though!\n",
      "I just started taking yoga classes, so I purchased these yoga capris. I love them! So soft and comfy that I just purchased a second pair.\n",
      "Perfect fit and the quality of the material was really really good.\n",
      "Super comfortable, but totally see-through! Returning, unfortunately.\n",
      "Love these yoga pants. Larger bottom approved. Not see through. I have bought other colors only in the heathered, light colors are a no no. They are see through!\n",
      "I could not love these more.  They are moisture wicking, stay in place and are squat-proof.  I want a pair in every color!\n",
      "Great Capri work out pants. I thought the waist band would be wider. They are just above a standard waist band. I own a pair that has a larger one. Overall great fit and does the job\n",
      "LOVE them!!! Pants and leggings are really hard to find just because of my heavier lower half. These fit amazingly and I love the small pocket at the top for my gym key. They're light and breathable, but you can't see through them!! My one thing is that they attract my cat's fur like CRAZY! I don't mind lint rolling though, they're worth it!\n",
      "Overall these are pretty good yoga pants for the price. They are a bit thinner than I expected but they are fully opaque and they fit very well.\n",
      "These are the best! Most comfortable leggings I've ever worn!\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Cute!  Bright. Nice material.\n",
      "Loved them\n",
      "Very comfy! Love these!\n",
      "Very comfy and fit as expected,would recommend to buy.\n",
      "I love all my 90 Degree By Reflex leggings! I might even say I'm obsessed with this this company. Their leggings are always really soft, and they're a thick enough material that I'm not worrying about them being see-through, even when not squatting/bending over. I would caution that this is true for the dark colors. In my experience, some of the brighter colors are more sheer - you know the kind of leggings I'm talking about - where you can see everything, when you bend over. Not a cute look.\n",
      "I was looking for a longer Capri legging and these are perfect. I also didn't want too tight a fit. So after reading the reviews I ordered an extra large and couldn't be more pleased. Perfect fit for me.\n",
      "You cannot find a better fitting pair of yoga capris for the $. They fit, do good things to the lower half of my body, and feel great. LOVE!\n",
      "I bought these in large to see if they would be roomy and comfortable just wearing around the house.  They are both of those, but I do not like them on me.  They stay in place and are not see through, but this color shows everything!  If you have an ounce of fat on you, do NOT get these.  I also ordered these in medium (my size) and they do the same.  I am NOT happy with this color.\n",
      "Great product, amazing value!\n",
      "Not for me bad quality\n",
      "As good as lululemons !\n",
      "Love these pants!!! Super high end and a price you can't beat! Original tags say $88 dollars!\n",
      "Excellent Quality, Perfect Fit, Rivals My Designer Brands!\n",
      "Awesome Purchase! Perfect Fit!\n",
      "These are right on-point for fit. So don't worry about size up and down or &#34;muffin top&#34; or any of that. I actually ordered these not noting the Brand and then went to *name-brand, big-box store* to see if they had reasonably priced workout clothes the next day and ended up trying on 3 different pairs of Power Flex pants that all fit perfectly and seemed better than even the CK and Nicole M. sets I have/tried on! I realized when I received these via Prime today that these were &#34;that same brand&#34; and breathed a sigh of relief knowing they'd fit well before I even put them on.\n",
      "To be clear....I am about a Size 10. I'm 5'7 with a 34 Large C Chest and pretty &#34;normal/average&#34; thighs and butt in relation to my overall size. I buy a &#34;Large&#34; in bottoms, typically because I'm &#34;long in the thigh&#34; and have problems with regular sizes not being long enough for my crotch --&#62;knee area. So I ended up sizing up or buying &#34;talls&#34; hoping to not have a crotch that's 2 inches below my actual body. These are PERFECT for long legs!! The length is awesome in that it's hard to find this length in-stores because they mostly label only &#34;Capri&#34; and &#34;Regular/Full&#34; lengths and you have to scavenge for this length. I love it that they're still long enough that I don't freeze in the Winter and Fall, but can still wear them in Spring and Warmer Weather.\n",
      "I know waistbands are really important to pretty much every woman. I'm using these for regular working out at the Gym as well as Physical Therapy for my back which means a Therapist is grabbing my body parts and flexing them for me (so you don't want super-wild pants and a weird fit both because therapy can be painful and because it would be embarrassing if butt-crack or muffin-top came out....you want WELL FITTED pants for this, trust me). These are perfect for both!\n",
      "*PLEASE NOTE* In my photos I left the tag on the pants to show that these are genuinely branded and marked properly and didn't realize that the tag was actually folding the waist-band down a bit. It's actually &#34;smooth&#34; all around. The band is thicker and double-seamed around the upper belly and these are about &#34;medium-rise&#34;. You could probably yank them up to make them a bit higher, but they honestly fit JUST right. There is the built-in &#34;pocket&#34; on the front-inside of the pants just like Nicole M. and other more expensive sets you may be used to. The band is flattering, but not too tight. The back is high enough for any butt no matter how large or small it is. The band leaves plenty of &#34;length&#34; so that there's no areas that you'd need to worry about even doing an extreme work-out or running.\n",
      "Most of all, I want to make clear how amazingly soft these are....but somehow thinner/more natural feeling & durable than other brands. I don't know what it is or how they do it....but these feel more like &#34;second skin&#34; than any other brand I've tried lots of Designer Brands.  Normally if you want &#34;durable&#34;....you get the really heavy/hot/thick pants that are less flexible. If you want &#34;thinner&#34; and &#34;cooler&#34; you get pants that aren't durable and shift around on your body. Somehow these are the perfect mix of both. They feel soft and &#34;medium&#34; thickness....but are still cool and super-flexible. But like the thicker blends, they stay very secure in the waistband and other areas and can handle tough workouts and stretching with no problem.\n",
      "And on a side note...I wasn't sure about ordering the &#34;Charcoal&#34; but they are a perfect heathered grey and they really look great with any of my bras, tees, and cover-ups because they are very neutral and look amazing on. My photos are &#34;meh&#34; as far as getting the color and fit using the selfie-cam, but you really only need to buy a pair of these yourself to find out that these are amazing quality and will make you forget your designer sets in favor of these. Excellent value, perfect fit, sizing on point, and amazing comfort and flexibility/durability! I highly, highly recommend these no matter what your preference or fitness demands!\n",
      "I bought my first pair at TJ Maxx and just bought two more. I love them, they are comfy and soft, and not see through. I plan on buying more in the future.\n",
      "These are my favorite yoga pants!\n",
      "These leggings are my new favorites! They're so comfy and stretchy. Just ordered another pair!\n",
      "Great value, overall quality lacking.\n",
      "This product would most likely get 2 stars, however I added one for price point. I purchased this item in &#34;Jade&#34; which is a lovely color. The material is moderately thin. Jade is a light color and may show &#34;too much&#34; if you're not careful. My biggest complaint is that the material is not compression whatsoever. My second complaint is that the light color shows dirt extremely easily. When I finished my indoor workout, my pants had areas which were discolored and dirty looking.\n",
      "Beware: Watermelon is HOT pink. Was hoping for more of a red/pink. I like pink so I'm not wasting my time sending them back. But I can definitely see someone being not as happy. Otherwise good brand.\n",
      "Way too big in the waist for what is considered a small, not the same quality at all as other capri pants they sell for less.\n",
      "Hands down the best yoga/workout pants out there for the price. I'm up to 5 pairs right now because I no longer have an interest in wearing any of my other ones and I own ALOT of them including Athleta. It's great to love something you didn't pay that much for.\n",
      "I have been looking for some new workout pants for months. I finally found the perfect fit, and at an excellent price! It seems that most pants now are so tight and unflattering unless you have super skinny legs. These are pants are the perfect cut. I am 125 lbs and 5' tall, and ordered size small. I will be ordering several more pairs.\n",
      "Had to return it, was too small.\n",
      "Very soft and comfortable! I will defiantly buy more in different colors :)\n",
      "Everyone else's reviews were so helpful! Thank you. Fits like a glove! I have no complaints. Perfect fit, color, thickness, style, etc. If you are on the fence, buy them! I promise you will not be disappointed.\n",
      "Love these pants! Every time I wear them someones says how cute they are.\n",
      "Love the fit and material!\n",
      "These capris are very comfortable to work out in; as long as the workout isn't high cardio. I've found that they fall down quite often and I'm spending most of the time pulling them up. I wear them for lifting weights and yoga and they work just fine for that.\n",
      "I loved the color and the fit however they showed too much of the private area.\n",
      "Very comfortable and does not slide down\n",
      "Perfect! Definitely worth the cost. Not flimsy WON'T come apart.  It's the real deal!!\n",
      "These are great!  Wish you made a shorter pant for summer workouts.\n",
      "👍\n",
      "These are perfect for girls with some thighs! The have the perfect compression to keep the jiggle in place without all the sheen. I'm 5'3&#34; size 14 and all that is in the legs and dairy air. With all that confession these pants are perfect for comfort, sleeping, lounging, and (ahem) yoga. I will definitely order additional colors.\n",
      "I recently purchased the black pair and when I got them, I fell in love!! I'm a plus size girl and typically wear a size 16, and I bought a large. They stretch perfect and fit my body just right! I loved them so much I bought a blue pair the other day! Highly recommend these!!\n",
      "They fit perfect and they're super cute\n",
      "Love these capri's.  They were delivered on time and fit perfectly!\n",
      "I'm so picky on leggings  and was so hesitant of buying online.  I ordered these based on the reviews and I do have a pair of leggings from this brand but a different kind and I really do like them.  I got these and I wasn't expecting them to be anything amazing  but oh man! I freaking love them. They don't move through my workout. They hide a lot of imperfections ( hallelujah),  and they're not see-through!!  Literally all of my leggings are see-through...specially since I do a lot of squats at the gym.  I have namebrand leggings that are supposed to be no show and it still shows but these did not! They made it through a leg day with no issues. I want them in every color!  For reference I'm 5'6, 130lbs (mostly in my thigh/butt area) and I ordered a small because I like mine thight\n",
      "Great quality for the price. Fit perfectly. I will definitely order again!!\n",
      "Love these!!!\n",
      "My favorite workout leggings by far! I have pretty wide hips and a smaller waist. Most times I have to go a size up to fit my hips and the waist ends up being too big. However, these leggings hug all of my curves JUST RIGHT! I have multiple pairs and the colors are so cute! Great buy!\n",

      "Great leggings for the price! In fact great leggings comparable to high-end brands. But a pair for each of my three girls. They love them!\n",
      "Good fit.  I like them.\n",
      "I loved these pants at first. I've had them for a little over 2 months and they are completely stretched out. I would not recommend them. Spend more money to get better quality pants because they'll last longer.\n",
      "I got these leggings in Heather Grey in a size medium (I'm 5'5&#34; and approximately 130lbs.). These pants are awesome! They fit perfectly around the waist and I will be ordering more! Great product for an amazing price!\n",
      "I originally ordered the blue but when I received them the stitching in the crotch was ripped, so I just simply just returned them and ordered a new pair. I am an avid weightlifter, and I live a very active lifestyle. And these guys held up on one of my leg days. However, I do sweat a lot and just a little bit sweat could be seen on my lower back through the leggings, but it wasn't anything too serious. I am 5'4, 145lbs bottom heavy and the small fit me perfectly.\n",
      "I love these pants-the color and the fit are perfect and flattering. Very high quality. Item arrived quickly!\n",
      "Literally only chose this pair of leggings because it had so many good reviews about not being see through and THEY WERE SEE THROUGH. Granted it isn't terrible, but squats are definitely a no, and idk if I'll even run in them. The fit is good, just wish they were a thicker material or something.\n",
      "These are amazing\n",
      "Color is great, quality is ok. I like leggings a little more thick with SOME degree of compression but these have minimal...also feel like the waist band is a little off, doesn't really lay flat. Really great for the price though, but I'll just splurge on my next pair from aerie because they can't be beat!\n",
      "I love these! I want to buy more!\n",
      "I wouldn't call these &#34;compression&#34; pants. They are comfortable and not nearly as tight or thick as true compression workout pants. Still, good quality for the price.\n",
      "The sizing/fit is perfect, I ordered the small.  The color is exactly as viewed on Amazon.  Very comfortable and fun to wear to my yoga classes.\n",
      "So amazingly soft, stretchy and awesome! I have 3 pairs and will definitely be ordering more. Perfect for the gym, lounge or just your everyday leggings. Love them! ❤\n",
      "I love these yogas! I actually have more in my cart to buy more! They are so comfy and flexible! If you need yogas to wear on any occasion these are the ones to get!\n",
      "Super comfortable and plan on buying again.\n",
      "Great in all ways!\n",

      "These leggings are perfect! The quality of the fabric exceeded my expectations. They are sturdy/structured but not heavy - and not at all transparent. The balance of compression and comfort is exactly what I had hoped - without the spandex &#34;shine&#34; of typical workout gear. Sizing is accurate. I am 5'4&#34;, 112lbs - roughly a size 2/4. I do not like my leggings to fit so snugly they create extra bumps and bulges, so a Small was spot on! Capri length on me is mid-calf. I will absolutely purchase more of these leggings for running, yoga and lounging. Delivery time was faster than anticipated. Thankful to have found this excellent product!\n",
      "Love them\n",
      "Love this brand. Great price, thick material, not cotton.\n",
      "I love these leggings! So glad I bought them! They are comfortable and the fit is perfect! I was worried the L may be too small since I'm at my heaviest weight. But they fit great! They are a teensy bit see through on the butt I noticed but I wear long tops over my leggings anyways so it's not a problem for me. I will probably be ordering more (:\n",
      "I love these capris.  Have tried out several other brands and have not been satisfied--finally I've found one that not only fits as expected but also looks decent--not so thin that you feel uncomfortable if you don't have a model's figure (!) but not too heavy either.  Just right for me.  Holds tummy and butt in but still very stretchy and best of all, does not slide down when I'm doing pilates on a roller!  I bought a medium in the Heather Charcoal (can't vouch for the other materials, see the material components description of various colors, they are not all the same).  I am 5'5&#34; and weigh about 122 pounds.  Price is reasonable for the quality.  They wash up well (by hand, and lay flat to dry).\n",
      "I am 145 pounds, 5'6 (and a half!) and I have wide hips and a mummy tummy (diastasis recti pooch from 3 kids late in life) - these pants in size Medium fit great! They seem comparable to much more expensive brands. They had a little toning/lifting with the compression and the band seemed thick enough to help flatten down my tummy lumps. The gray heather ones don't seem to be see through when bending over. Overall impressed with these pants and will search for more in different colors\n",

I love them so much! I have so many pairs of these from a combination of TJMaxx and Amazon. I got the color sage this time and it is almost like a off-olive green and I love it so much! Really comfortable to wear and perfect for either cardio or weight lifting. Definitely recommend!\n",
      "I love these pants. I own around 4 pairs of leggings from this brand and these are by far the best. I am 5'4&#34; 120lb and I ordered a small in the lavender gray and they fit wonderfully. I recommend ordering these!!\n",

      "Not as long as pictured on the website. I know they said capri, but the photo shown appeared to be more of an ankle pant. I'm only 5' tall, and these were quite short on me. Shame, because I do really love the other products this brand makes.\n",
      "Perfect for cycling and working out. I ordered a Large (I'm 5 ft 6in, 160 pounds) but it was a little loose, especially around the waist. However, I'm giving it 5 stars since it is so comfortable! I like wearing it even when I'm not working out because of the soft texture, and the fact that it slips down a little bit doesn't bother me. Probably ordering another in Medium.\n",
      "Fit perfect. Love them.\n",
      "Color in the picture is way off. I thought it would be more of the bright color like the picture but instead its a light aqua color that i'm now afraid to wear because it will get way too dirty.\n",

      "Considering the reviews on these leggings I was expecting much better quality. Thin material, definitely not to be worn without something covering your butt/front because it would be see through for sure.\n",
      "If your'e looking for nicer leggings for yoga/exercise/everything, try Zella. You can get them on Ebay, typically around $40, but after trying these leggings the $40 is well worth it. Zella's leggings are way thicker and more reliable.\n",
      "Live in these. The are super comfy, fit well, and don't stretch out.\n",
      "Super cute! Love that the material is thicker so they aren't see through.\n",
      "These pants are amazingly flattering. Honestly, they are a distraction from my workouts because I can't stop looking at my butt in the mirror.\n",
      "These leggings have a lot of potential.. they are a great material and NOT see through. I'm well endowed in the rear end and finding leggings that aren't see through and $100 is difficult. The only thing is that these leggings are a little big in the crotch area and don't stay up that well so I definitely don't recommend for working out.\n",

      "Love them so much!! Wear them all the time at the gym, they're extremely stretchy and comfortable.\n",
      "** Warning! Ive had my pair for over 6 months now, and use them often... the pants really start to become more loose over time and stretch out. So if I buy them again, I might even go a size smaller because they've stretched out by now.\n",
      "Great material and not see through! I love them. More comfortable than any nikes I've ever bought/worn.\n",

      "I love these. I have only had them about a month, so I can't speak for wear and tear yet. But the fit is great. It doesn't roll down my waist so I'm not hiking them up all the time. They are comfortable, I'm 5'9 and they come down just below mid calf. I do not feel they are 100% not see through. So I personally wear a long shirt with them, unless I'm working out home. But I also have a big booty. In a smaller gal, they probs my are not see through at all.\n",

      "I ordered this twice the black pair. First time i got long dark grey and they r not 90 degree they r some off brand! Second time I got what I ordered. Hoping they make the first order right for me. I love love love these leggings and have about 15 pair 😂\n",

It looked like it haf been returned because the packaging was not the same as the other two pairs of leggings.  The one with the tear also did not have the 90 Degree tag with it either.  I returned those for a refund.  The other two pair I really am happy with however one of the items was not the color I ordered however; I liked it and kept it.\n",

      "These are AMAZING. The fit is fantastic. They do not show anything when bending over. Love,love them. Four pair for the price of one Lucy pair.\n",
      "These leggings are so comfortable! I put they fit somewhat large because of how stretchy they are. They are perfect for hiding the muffin top unlike other leggings in the same size. They also have a small hidden pocket that is perfect for holding keys!\n",
      "Love these leggings - nice thick material (not see through) and the length is perfection. I am 5'7&#34; about 145 lbs and ordered the medium. They come up just below my belly button, which I love for it's love handle cinching quality.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE these leggings! They are so comfortable and I love that they are somewhat high waisted. The material is thick and durable, not cheapy feeling at all. It goes on nice and smooth and isn't sheer or see through.  I worked out in them the other day and there was no problem, no sweat, it felt great.  I will absolutely most definitely, positively be purchasing more of these again and again!  I want to try the high waisted tummy control, I love high waisted leggings.\n",
      "Beautiful color!\n",
      "I have found that their sizing in general has changed a bit. Runs a little smaller than before. Fabric contents may have something to do with this change?  I have in fact even lost some weight so I'm sure that they are running smaller than previous purchases.\n",
      "These are my favorite leggings. Nice and thick and have great stretch\n",
      "These are my all time favorite workout pants. I am 5'7&#34; and I have a hard time finding crop pants that are not almost at my knees. These are more like ankle length or slightly above and I love them. Bought 5 pairs.\n",
      "I love these.  The material is great.\n",

      "I was hesitant to try Yoga pants for exercise, but they are great.  since I have worn mine, several other women in my group are wearing yoga pants too.  The 90 degree is perfect, comfortable, looks great.  Can't say enough good about them.  I did read the reviews and ordered XL instead of L and they are a good fit.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE PANTS! Fits true to size for reference I'm 5'2 125 lbs and got a small. I've spent hundreds on designer workout pants and after these I'm never going back! Really great colors that stay true even after washing!\n",

They do not pass the deadlift/squat test :) - trust me - but they would work for running/cardio/etc - just wouldn't recommend for leg day. The other pair I have - bright pink -- VERY hot pink - is made with more polyester and those are not see through. Hope that helps!\n",

      "-Comfy fit & buttery feel\n",

      "love the color and is very comfortable and supports perfectly!\n",

They are a bit more athletic (slight sheen) than I expected, but they are super comfortable and have a tiny change pocket hidden in front. Also, a long t-shirt or cotton dress slides nicely over them when I walk, which is nice.\n",
      "These leggings are so soft and the sage color is really nice.\n",
      "I really like the fit of these yoga pants. The material is soft and comfortable with just a little compression. This is my second pair. The only reason I didn't make it 5 stars is that the color was not as expected. I ordered &#34;lavender grey&#34; and expected, based on the product photos, for it to be a darker grey with just a tint of purple, but these are basically light lilac.\n",

      "The leggings are more high-waisted than in the photo but the fit is good, my wife is 5' 2&#34;, 130lbs & the small fits her well.\n",
      "90 Degree make the BEST workout pants. Own probably 4 different pairs of pants by this company. I purchased the magenta color this time to add to my collection. I love these pants because they are soft, comfortable, breathable, fitted just right to accent my features and the best part is they are thick and NOT see through!! I wear these for all of my different work out classes and they are great. I wash them in cold and hang dry, they last a long time and don't fade. I am 5'9, around 150 and can wear a medium or large. I got a large in these.\n",
      "These were great -- the small was a tiny bit snug but not really a problem. I'm 5'5&#34; and these were just a little longer than pictured, but I'm used to my pants being kind of long because models are usually several inches taller than me. I just scrunched them up a bit at the ankle to look more like capris. The length actually makes them very versatile because they can seem like regular length leggings or capris on someone my height depending on how you wear them. The material was nice and thick while still being breathable. I've washed them a couple of times and they still look new. Overall I'm very impressed by this brand and the quality of their products for such a low price!\n",
      "These are literally the perfect pants. If your weight fluctuates, these pants always fit and look good. I live in these!!!\n",
      "I love this company, soft, fits true to size, beautiful colors and lasts all my crazy workouts!\n",
      "I love these yoga pants, they fit great,feel good,  they are not see through.  I have them now in 2 colors and plan to get a few more colors.  I would definetly recommend these !\n",
      "I bought these a side larger since I already owned a pair from TJMax and love them. I was happy to find another pair on Amozon.\n",
      "I have about 5 pair of these pants. They fit great and are a really good quality. They don't roll down, they stay put and don't restrict movement in any way. Also I am really short so it's hard to find pants that don't bunch up at the ankle, I find these work great as full length for me.\n",
      "Perfectly fitting, comfortable, and opaque everyday leggings for wearing constantly. I will be ordering again!\n",
      "My wife loves them. Super soft and comfy. Fits good.\n",
      "Good value. Launder nicely. thick enough to conceal under garment. Wish they came in white and maybe a little shorter (the reason for the 4 STARS). Very satisfied with the quality and wearability. My go to brand...will order again.\n",
      "This brand has turned into my favorite brand of leggings. I can put them in the wash and dryer and they're still holding up....color, stretch, and all.\n",
      "These Capri's will draw a lot of attention because the color is so bright. I ordered XS because I like them to stay up on my waist, I typically wear a size 4 so I can also go up in size to a small if I want to but for some reasons the smalls don't really stay up as I like them to.  Very stretchable a not see through at all.... you will love them!\n",
      "I wanted to keep these so bad! They seem great quality and fit great everywhere except the waist...they ran extremely small!\n",
      "Not a whole lot to say except that these are GREAT capris pants.\n",
      "These leggings are perfect and look great on me. I bought them to wear to yoga and gym classes but they look so good I think\n",
      "I will save them for dressier occasions.\n",
      "Love these pants! They are super comfy, super stretchy and great for the gym and lounging around. They are not see through at all when you bend over which is great.\n",
      "They were a bit snug but I kind of prefer it that way as they don't move much when i work out.\n",
      "For reference, I ordered a small and I am 5'4&#34;, 130lbs and am not super thin through the thighs and hips.\n",
      "Super comfortable and the best part is it holds everything in place like my stomach! Other workout pants I've tried tend to roll down and I was constantly adjusting.\n",
      "This is my husband's account, but I bought these for myself. For the value, these pants are awesome. You can't see through them (I have $98 lulu's and you can), they have enough elastic to feel support, yet they are durable (I was constantly) and comfortable. The waist can be slightly tight but it's not too bad. I ordered 5 pairs in different colors and sizes.\n",
      "These pants are very comfy, fit as expected and I love that they offer them in ao many colors. But beware, they are see through in the back, definitely NOT gym/ squat approved and I would venture to say, probably not for that downeard dog in yoga either. If you are OK with your special parts playing peek-a-boo, then by all means buy these pants. Otherwise, these would be good for lounging around and running errands.\n",
      "perfect fit...love them !!\n",
      "Beautiful sage green and perfect fit!\n",
      "around the calves its a little large and does not hug my foot. maybe if i had gotten a smaller size it would work better\n",
      "Have bought 6-8 pairs of these leggings. Amazing! Squat proof! I'm a size 4/6 and bought mediums. Fit perfect. Will keep buying!\n",
      "I have had two pairs of these before that I had purchased at Marshalls so knew exactly how they fit and the nice quality of them.  I especially like that they have a small pocket in the waistband where you can put some money, a credit card or license, keys, etc. so you can be hands free.  They are of a good quality material that has stretch, some firmness control and no telltale see through.\n",
      "they fit fine, but the color I got was very see through! I can not speak for the other colors but the silver is transparent\n",
      "nice fit\n",
      "great product!! good tummy control! 5'7 140 medium fits perfect\n",
      "I like the color, length, and soft fabric however I wish it would be a little bit thinner.\n",
      "Absolutely love this brand of leggings. These are true squat non see through Capri! They feel so comfortable I wear them everyday even underneath my skirts and dresses.\n",
      "These capris fit very nicely.  Not a capri-wearing lady, but after recent abdominal surgery, I needed some stretchy-style pants to wear until I could fit into my regular clothes.\n",
      "These were really comfortable and the color is very versatile.\n",
      "Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars:  I ordered 2 different brands of capris, and one of them is now spamming me with email marketing messages.  DO NOT appreciate that!\n",
      "Love, love, love these pants! Absolutely a must have! I have the &#34;mom stomach&#34; and these help control it ☺️\n",
      "I love love love these capris. They are a great value, the cut is complementary, and the length is perfect (I'm 5' 6&#34;). Just the thing I need to wear with tunics and tees and sandals. They'll be perfect for fall, too, with my Converse. I ordered 3 of these and already own 4 of the longer length yoga pants from 90 Degree by Reflex.\n",
      "I really like the quality of these yoga pants but I wish they had a length option for shorter people. I'm 5'5&#34; and I ordered the cropped ones and they awkwardly end just above my ankles not at my calves like I expected.\n",
      "They fit to size, feel amazing and I look thinner lol\n",
      "Seriously they are well made and wash really good!\n",
      "Will buy MANY many more of these pants! I was contemplating busting out $100 for some lulu. However, I found these originally at TjMaxx and fell in love with them immediately. They feel like skin, but not too thin. I've worn other very thin yoga pants that showed my cellulite, but these do NOT show through at all! I am 5'3&#34; and I do have to bunch them up jussstttt a little so the ankle/calf opening isn't gaping. Sort of expected at this height though.\n",
      "Perfect fit but a little long so i roll them up twice at the bottom. I am 5'2&#34;\n",
      "Very comfortable pants! I'm 5'2 and about 135 pounds and ordered a a black in medium, though I think I could've gotten away with a small. I have thicker thighs and calves and smaller waist, which means that many tights fit me too tight around my legs. However, this isn't a problem with these! I also love that they aren't see through.\n",
      "Overall, I'd definitely recommend and am considering ordering other colors.\n",
      "Love this company! Every pair of pants that I have purchased, and I think I have 5, are amazing! Great fit! Great feel! Will definitely continue to order. Company also has amazing customer service- after receiving a defective pair, they quickly shipped out a new pair.\n",
      "I love these. They are comfy not see through. I can wear them to work out or make them casual with a cute shirt and flip flops.\n",
      "These pants are utterly amazing!!! I've bought pants for triple the cost that don't fit as well as these do! They stay up over your belly if you have one left over like me from kids! I also have bigger legs and they compress but don't cut off circulation! I am going back to buy 3 more pairs!!\n",
      "Love these!\n",
      "Fit great! Passes the bend over test. Material is thick but not heavy. I was concerned that the light color would show cellulite on the back of my legs but it camouflaged wonderfully! The color is vibrant and fun!\n",
      "This was my 5 or 6th purchase of these pants. By far my favorite. Nice material that's not too thin. Fit just right.  Great price and I always receive quickly. They keep their shape even after laundering.\n",
      "Awesome quality with very high-end feel. Fit is perfect (XL for 190 lb weight). Very complementary. Bought these to wear as a capri-layer under tropical print boutique dress but they are substantial enough to wear as exercise tights without it looking tacky.  Looks fantastic!\n",
      "Bought these to match a specific workout top and while the color is nice, the fit and material aren't particularly flattering, and what's worse is they show every drop of sweat... even in the knees (yeah, who knew knees sweat?!) but the crotch area was particularly mortifying. These might be fine for yoga but wouldn't recommend for anything more sweaty or strenuous than that.\n",
      "Love these so much!\n",
      "I'm very athletic, with a smaller than normal waist due to my weight lifting & high levels of cardio, so they fit a little large around the waist!\n",
      "If you an average body, then these pants would probably fit perfectly\n",
      "Product was exactly as described, fit great, & was the perfect length\n",
      "Love these! I was looking for pink yoga pants- I actually bought these AND a pair from lululemon the same week... and I like these better!!\n",
      "The best darn deal for capris I have yet to discover.  They fit like a dream!  Medium is a medium.  The crotch behaves as one would hope as in no creeping up anywhere it should not.\n",
      "I tried on SO many pairs of work out pants and could not find any that fit the way I needed them to. I figured I would give these a try and they are amazing! The high waist gives acts as a control top and the fabric does not cut into my crotch in an unappealing way. Sorry for that visual but it is a real problem when it comes to these types of pants. I am very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "I LOVE these yoga pants.  I have a collection! BEST exercise pants I've found!\n",
      "New favorite pair of leggings! I've already ordered them in 3 different colors. I love the way they feel on and they are very flattering. Absolutely love!!!\n",
      "So comfy and such a great price!!\n",
      "Great quality but too big for me.\n",
      "Love these capri leggings.  Great fit.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE. most comfortable leggings EVER.  I'm buying 2 more pair!\n",
      "They are not tight around the calves/ankle, and have weird creases in odd places that don't go away which makes these look cheap. I love the sage color, but the fit is weird around the lower leg. Wish the sage color came in full length.\n",
      "These are my favorite Capri yoga pants. I've bought 2 pairs of them and I wear them all the time. I'm 4'10 so they fit more like a crop pant than a Capri but either way I still love them!\n",
      "Good\n",
      "Squat proof! love the color\n",
      "So comfortable! I am definitely going to be ordering some more in different colors!\n",
      "Love, love, love these workout capris!  Will buy more.  Absorbed the sweat real well, fit perfectly.  Comfortable.\n",
      "Literally the best workout leggings I've ever owned. I'm 5'4&#34; so they fit almost like a 7/8 legging. So comfortable and lightweight but not see-through.\n",
      "Love these leggings. Comparable to some other expensive brands at a quarter of the price.\n",
      "Love them they do have a little stretch so if you like em tight I think you can get away with a smaller size than usual\n",
      "Great value.  Holds up well after multiple washings ( in an old crappy machine)\n",
      "great pants\n",
      "None\n",
      "I'm so happy I found these online! I'm 5'4&#34; and 150 lbs., size 8 but I ordered a size large. I think a medium might have been a better choice but I'm still very happy with these. I don't have &#34;cricket legs&#34; (chubby thighs rubbing together) and so far I haven't noted any pilling anywhere.  The colors are gorgeous, the material is cool and breathes even though it compresses nicely and holds everything where it should be. I'm a little bit overweight (I refuse to say curvy, because curvy to me is just a delicate way of saying I'm fat). I've been toning up and have been developing some decent muscle tone. I'm losing weight so will be back for more of these amazing capris later when I'm down another size!\n",
      "I love these yoga capris. I like that they have a slightly higher waist, they are extremely comfortable and fit perfectly.  I bought them in 3 colors.\n",
      "Great pants. Stretchy material.  They're not too tight and I can work out in them.  Running or squats aren't a problem.  The back stays in place and doesn't show off what color my undies are.\n",
      "Wow I love these pants! They are a nice, thick (not too thick, but substantial) material with a good amount of elasticity so they fit well and are super comfy. I bought them for the gym but wore them to work under a tunic because I couldn't wait to wear them. The material is thick and not at all see-through. I haven't washed them yet, so I can't say if they'll pill, but right now I'm very happy with them - I ordered two more pair...\n",

      "I wear leggings a lot and these are my favorite cropped-length leggings.  I think there is a difference between capris and cropped, and I prefer the latter, finding it longer.  I usually wear a M and considered ordering these in L, but I'm glad I got the M's.  I ordered some bright colors that are great for summer.  These leggings are NOT see-through and some might consider them heavy, but I love how strong they are.\n",
      "Kinda see through and definitely not good for cellulite- these almost amplify it! Love the color though and super comfy!\n",
      "Comfortable cropped legging\n",
      "I am 5'4, 220 lbs and ordered a size small. I would 100% recommend these leggings!! They are so comfortable and flattering! They fit perfectly... great for exercise like yoga and barre because I have full range of motion in my legs and not constricting at all! . Also love to wear them casually during the day!\n",
      "These are really cute and fit great, wash great\n",
      "I'm short at 5' so these are more like yoga pants on me but I love them!\n",
      "I usually get a size Small in 90 Degree Leggings and they fit perfect! I am 5'5 and 130 pounds and I usually am a size medium in shorts however their small loose and not tight at all on me! I love them so much! I have so many pairs of these from a combination of TJMaxx and Amazon. I got the color sage this time and it is almost like a off-olive green and I love it so much! Really comfortable to wear and perfect for either cardio or weight lifting. Definitely recommend!\n",
      "I love these pants. I own around 4 pairs of leggings from this brand and these are by far the best. I am 5'4&#34; 120lb and I ordered a small in the lavender gray and they fit wonderfully. I recommend ordering these!!\n",
      "these are awesome for the price!\n",
      "These are a great fit and are not seethrough\n",
      "These feel like heaven when they're on!!! Love!\n",
      "Fit great! Very comfortable to work out in!\n",
      "I love these leggings. They are my go to for pilates. Insanely comfortable and they cover all the goods from behind and are completely opaque. Will buy again.\n",
      "Not as long as pictured on the website. I know they said capri, but the photo shown appeared to be more of an ankle pant. I'm only 5' tall, and these were quite short on me. Shame, because I do really love the other products this brand makes.\n",
      "Perfect for cycling and working out. I ordered a Large (I'm 5 ft 6in, 160 pounds) but it was a little loose, especially around the waist. However, I'm giving it 5 stars since it is so comfortable! I like wearing it even when I'm not working out because of the soft texture, and the fact that it slips down a little bit doesn't bother me. Probably ordering another in Medium.\n",
      "Fit perfect. Love them.\n",
      "Color in the picture is way off. I thought it would be more of the bright color like the picture but instead its a light aqua color that i'm now afraid to wear because it will get way too dirty.\n",
      "Great fit and quality.\n",
      "Considering the reviews on these leggings I was expecting much better quality. Thin material, definitely not to be worn without something covering your butt/front because it would be see through for sure.\n",
      "If your'e looking for nicer leggings for yoga/exercise/everything, try Zella. You can get them on Ebay, typically around $40, but after trying these leggings the $40 is well worth it. Zella's leggings are way thicker and more reliable.\n",
      "Live in these. The are super comfy, fit well, and don't stretch out.\n",
      "Super cute! Love that the material is thicker so they aren't see through.\n",
      "These pants are amazingly flattering. Honestly, they are a distraction from my workouts because I can't stop looking at my butt in the mirror.\n",
      "These leggings have a lot of potential.. they are a great material and NOT see through. I'm well endowed in the rear end and finding leggings that aren't see through and $100 is difficult. The only thing is that these leggings are a little big in the crotch area and don't stay up that well so I definitely don't recommend for working out.\n",
      "I love love these yoga power flex capris!!they fit great!shipping was fast.great buy!!\n",
      "Love these workout leggings. They are high waisted so they hold everything in place. They don't roll down when you bend over. The length is perfect. Everything stays put through my workout and I'm not tugging on my leggings every few minutes. I want every color now!\n",
      "Love them so much!! Wear them all the time at the gym, they're extremely stretchy and comfortable.\n",
      "** Warning! Ive had my pair for over 6 months now, and use them often... the pants really start to become more loose over time and stretch out. So if I buy them again, I might even go a size smaller because they've stretched out by now.\n",
      "Great material and not see through! I love them. More comfortable than any nikes I've ever bought/worn.\n",
      "These are perfect. So soft, not see through at all, and great fit. Just the right amount of compression. I already ordered more. And they don't retain any sweat odor either\n",
      "Great basic capris for running or yoga.\n",
      "I love these. I have only had them about a month, so I can't speak for wear and tear yet. But the fit is great. It doesn't roll down my waist so I'm not hiking them up all the time. They are comfortable, I'm 5'9 and they come down just below mid calf. I do not feel they are 100% not see through. So I personally wear a long shirt with them, unless I'm working out home. But I also have a big booty. In a smaller gal, they probs my are not see through at all.\n",
      "-Beca\n",
      "a little on the small side\n",
      "they are a good length and the color is as expected.\n",
      "As I reviewed on the other pair of these I purchased (high waist in the color sea green). These leggings are low cost with high quality craftsmanship and materials. Soft and durable, not see through regardless of how much you stretch them! I have recommended them to several people!\n",
      "I bought these pants a few months ago and LOVE them so I bought another pair. New pair has a different fabric makeup and are awful. The new ones are see-through too. Bring back the old ones!\n",
      "Lavender grey is shown as a light grey color and the lavender grey I got was the same color as violet storm. They fit well, a tad smaller than other 90 degree leggings I have... Ill have to return I guess but I'd like the actual lavender grey leggings.\n",
      "I ordered this twice the black pair. First time i got long dark grey and they r not 90 degree they r some off brand! Second time I got what I ordered. Hoping they make the first order right for me. I love love love these leggings and have about 15 pair 😂\n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely love it. The color along with the comfortability makes it a very good purchase. I plan to buy more...\n",
      "I ordered three pairs of these leggings.  The first one I took out of the package had a hole in the seam of the left leg.  It looked like it haf been returned because the packaging was not the same as the other two pairs of leggings.  The one with the tear also did not have the 90 Degree tag with it either.  I returned those for a refund.  The other two pair I really am happy with however one of the items was not the color I ordered however; I liked it and kept it.\n",
      "Love these yoga pants\n",
      "Very comfortable - material is nice\n",
      "Wow. Love these. Soft, good amount of stretch and squat proof! Waist band comes up high and stays in place. Purchased bc of a YouTube review I watched and am very pleased. They last through my crossfit wod and look good when I go to the grocery after.\n",
      "Love the feel of the fabric but they run way too small.\n",
      "These are AMAZING. The fit is fantastic. They do not show anything when bending over. Love,love them. Four pair for the price of one Lucy pair.\n",
      "These leggings are so comfortable! I put they fit somewhat large because of how stretchy they are. They are perfect for hiding the muffin top unlike other leggings in the same size. They also have a small hidden pocket that is perfect for holding keys!\n",
      "Love these leggings - nice thick material (not see through) and the length is perfection. I am 5'7&#34; about 145 lbs and ordered the medium. They come up just below my belly button, which I love for it's love handle cinching quality.\n",
      "I absolutely LOVE these leggings! They are so comfortable and I love that they are somewhat high waisted. The material is thick and durable, not cheapy feeling at all. It goes on nice and smooth and isn't sheer or see through.  I worked out in them the other day and there was no problem, no sweat, it felt great.  I will absolutely most definitely, positively be purchasing more of these again and again!  I want to try the high waisted tummy control, I love high waisted leggings.\n",
      "Beautiful color!\n",
      "I have found that their sizing in general has changed a bit. Runs a little smaller than before. Fabric contents may have something to do with this change?  I have in fact even lost some weight so I'm sure that they are running smaller than previous purchases.\n",
      "These are my favorite leggings. Nice and thick and have great stretch\n",
      "These are my all time favorite workout pants. I am 5'7&#34; and I have a hard time finding crop pants that are not almost at my knees. These are more like ankle length or slightly above and I love them. Bought 5 pairs.\n",
      "I love these.  The material is great.\n",
      "These are the best capris ever!!!  They are so compfy and they look awesome on me!!!  I ordered two pairs on accident but I'm not even returning them because I'll wear them so much I my as well keep them.\n",
      "I was hesitant to try Yoga pants for exercise, but they are great.  since I have worn mine, several other women in my group are wearing yoga pants too.  The 90 degree is perfect, comfortable, looks great.  Can't say enough good about them.  I did read the reviews and ordered XL instead of L and they are a good fit.\n",
      "LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE PANTS! Fits true to size for reference I'm 5'2 125 lbs and got a small. I've spent hundreds on designer workout pants and after these I'm never going back! Really great colors that stay true even after washing!\n",
      "Very comfy yoga pants with great style! Great price too!\n",
      "Perfect fit! Love them!\n",
      "Love it. I will buy another one soon.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "I returned them. Too small\n",
      "Just like the pair I bought in a Department store. It' even has the same Item Number. I was surprised!  🤗\n",
      "Did not like the quality or the fit. Gave me an awful muffin top! Spent the extra money and bought a pair from Zella. Worth every penny!!\n",
      "Love these yoga pants. They don't roll down and fit great. They also wash well. I want more colors now. I have black and gray but will be adding to my yoga wardrobe.\n",
      "Extremely comfortable, durable, and wonderful! I am so thankful that I found awesome workout pants that I was able to buy in every color of the rainbow because they were so affordable!!!\n",
      "Nice light weight flexible comfortable yoga pants. It's hard to find yoga pants that don't feel heavy and hot. It's hard for me to workout in uncomfortable clothing. Also bought the tops to match.\n",
      "I absolutely love these, Great colors and quality for the price.\n",
      "A little lighter than pictured, but otherwise a great pair of workout pants! Love 90 Degree, their active wear never disappoints.\n",
      "Love them, color is great and super comfy!\n",
      "Love these! Such a great price, comfortable, and the perfect length!\n",
      "Product is alright, first time I wore them the strings already started coming undone.\n",
      "I love these leggings! I ordered the &#34;purple impressions&#34; color, although they don't really look purple, they look much more blue than purple (see picture) I still love the color. They are very comfortable, and not see-through which is a major plus. I would definitely ordered these in other colors :)\n",
      "These pants are AMAZING!! So comfy and flexable! I can't wait to order more in every color\n",
      "Love the fit of these the heather charcoal changes color with swear but I still like the color.\n",
      "Very comfortable and a great fit. However, the black ones (made with 87% nylon) ARE SEE THROUGH. They do not pass the deadlift/squat test :) - trust me - but they would work for running/cardio/etc - just wouldn't recommend for leg day. The other pair I have - bright pink -- VERY hot pink - is made with more polyester and those are not see through. Hope that helps!\n",
      "the coral color seems to fit differently, maybe it's just the color is rather unflattering on me (i.e. cellulite central which isn't generally visible) when the other colors have been much more flattering.\n",
      "Material is great, might show a little cellulite if you have lots.\n",
      "I have been searching for the perfect pair of capris that are long enough where they won't ride up my legs and end up bunched at the knees. I'm a tall person. These are amazing and I will be buying more!! Comfortable, soft and not see through.\n",
      "Love them!\n",
      "Love it.\n",
      "I wear a size 8 and I got a medium. They were too snug for my comfort and fit more like compression pants. I'll go up a size so I can wear them for yoga but won't feel like I'm on display if I have to run to the store in them.\n",
      "Pros\n",
      "They don't cut into your lady bits (no camel toe)\n",
      "They are thick and well made\n",
      "Provide support (if you want them tight)\n",
      "Priced right\n",
      "Cons\n",
      "They are too snug for yoga and every day wear.\n",
      "I can feel the horizontal seam in the crotch area (hoping this will be remedied with a larger size)\n",
      "you van see threw them\n",
      "I am 5'2. 132lbs. Usually a size small.\n",
      "My Purchase: color Sage - small\n",
      "I've had a pair of their leggings from Marshalls. This is my first purchase of their capris. I've worn these multiple times so I could give a more accurate review from my experience. I wash machine them in cold water & put them in the dryer.\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "-Comfy fit & buttery feel\n",
      "-Doesn't suffocate\n",
      "-Not see through (did bent over test - could be because it's a bit loose on me, so the material isn't super stretched)\n",
      "-Keeps you cool through workout\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "-Not true to size for me (bit loose). Had to pull them up a few times while working out.\n",
      "-Due to the stitching down the crotch - beware of camel toe!\n",
      "-Crotch area fits a bit loose\n",
      "-Sweat stain (dries up quickly) doesn't bother me though\n",
      "All in all, I kept this pair. Still love it. Will purchase XS next order. Would highly recommend others to give it a go!\n",
      "These are sooooo comfortable and I love that they sit slightly high on my hips and hide my mommy tummy. Plus they're 'squat proof' (not see through), super soft, and don't make you overheat at the gym.\n",
      "Perfect, currently my favorite pair of leggings\n",
      "love the color and is very comfortable and supports perfectly!\n",
      "I bought these to wear on vacation with skirts and over-sized shirt. I am 5' 6&#34;, 125 lbs, I got a small and they fit snug/comfy. They are a bit more athletic (slight sheen) than I expected, but they are super comfortable and have a tiny change pocket hidden in front. Also, a long t-shirt or cotton dress slides nicely over them when I walk, which is nice.\n",
      "These leggings are so soft and the sage color is really nice.\n",
      "I really like the fit of these yoga pants. The material is soft and comfortable with just a little compression. This is my second pair. The only reason I didn't make it 5 stars is that the color was not as expected. I ordered &#34;lavender grey&#34; and expected, based on the product photos, for it to be a darker grey with just a tint of purple, but these are basically light lilac.\n",
      "Good quality and fit.  No roll down or up of the waistband during yoga sessions.  Very comfortable. Have already ordered a 2nd pair.\n",
      "Love the quality and price of these leggings!! You won't be disappointed! There's even a hidden pocket for your phone/cash.\n",
      "If you're short like me (5'3&#34;), you'll probably have to roll them up at the bottom. They're cropped but they fit awkwardly on my calf. Not bad at all for the price.\n",
      "absolutely love them but i will be getting x small next time. a must buy.\n",
      "Very nice high quality product. Washes well. Feels great.\n",
      "Love! Great material\n",
      "Impressed... As a LuluLemon lover.  These pants are comfortable, high waisted, seem to be a great material.\n",
      "Really comfortable and fits well!\n",
      "The leggings are more high-waisted than in the photo but the fit is good, my wife is 5' 2&#34;, 130lbs & the small fits her well.\n",
      "90 Degree make the BEST workout pants. Own probably 4 different pairs of pants by this company. I purchased the magenta color this time to add to my collection. I love these pants because they are soft, comfortable, breathable, fitted just right to accent my features and the best part is they are thick and NOT see through!! I wear these for all of my different work out classes and they are great. I wash them in cold and hang dry, they last a long time and don't fade. I am 5'9, around 150 and can wear a medium or large. I got a large in these.\n",
      "These were great -- the small was a tiny bit snug but not really a problem. I'm 5'5&#34; and these were just a little longer than pictured, but I'm used to my pants being kind of long because models are usually several inches taller than me. I just scrunched them up a bit at the ankle to look more like capris. The length actually makes them very versatile because they can seem like regular length leggings or capris on someone my height depending on how you wear them. The material was nice and thick while still being breathable. I've washed them a couple of times and they still look new. Overall I'm very impressed by this brand and the quality of their products for such a low price!\n",
      "These are literally the perfect pants. If your weight fluctuates, these pants always fit and look good. I live in these!!!\n",
      "I love this company, soft, fits true to size, beautiful colors and lasts all my crazy workouts!\n",
      "I love these yoga pants, they fit great,feel good,  they are not see through.  I have them now in 2 colors and plan to get a few more colors.  I would definetly recommend these !\n",
      "I bought these a side larger since I already owned a pair from TJMax and love them. I was happy to find another pair on Amozon.\n",
      "I have about 5 pair of these pants. They fit great and are a really good quality. They don't roll down, they stay put and don't restrict movement in any way. Also I am really short so it's hard to find pants that don't bunch up at the ankle, I find these work great as full length for me.\n",
      "Perfectly fitting, comfortable, and opaque everyday leggings for wearing constantly. I will be ordering again!\n",
      "My wife loves them. Super soft and comfy. Fits good.\n",
      "Good value. Launder nicely. thick enough to conceal under garment. Wish they came in white and maybe a little shorter (the reason for the 4 STARS). Very satisfied with the quality and wearability. My go to brand...will order again.\n",
      "This brand has turned into my favorite brand of leggings. I can put them in the wash and dryer and they're still holding up....color, stretch, and all.\n",
      "These Capri's will draw a lot of attention because the color is so bright. I ordered XS because I like them to stay up on my waist, I typically wear a size 4 so I can also go up in size to a small if I want to but for some reasons the smalls don't really stay up as I like them to.  Very stretchable a not see through at all.... you will love them!\n",
      "I wanted to keep these so bad! They seem great quality and fit great everywhere except the waist...they ran extremely small!\n",
      "Not a whole lot to say except that these are GREAT capris pants.\n",
      "These leggings are perfect and look great on me. I bought them to wear to yoga and gym classes but they look so good I think\n",
      "I will save them for dressier occasions.\n",
      "Love these pants! They are super comfy, super stretchy and great for the gym and lounging around. They are not see through at all when you bend over which is great.\n",
      "They were a bit snug but I kind of prefer it that way as they don't move much when i work out.\n",
      "For reference, I ordered a small and I am 5'4&#34;, 130lbs and am not super thin through the thighs and hips.\n",
      "Super comfortable and the best part is it holds everything in place like my stomach! Other workout pants I've tried tend to roll down and I was constantly adjusting.\n",
      "This is my husband's account, but I bought these for myself. For the value, these pants are awesome. You can't see through them (I have $98 lulu's and you can), they have enough elastic to feel support, yet they are durable (I was constantly) and comfortable. The waist can be slightly tight but it's not too bad. I ordered 5 pairs in different colors and sizes.\n",
      "These pants are very comfy, fit as expected and I love that they offer them in ao many colors. But beware, they are see through in the back, definitely NOT gym/ squat approved and I would venture to say, probably not for that downeard dog in yoga either. If you are OK with your special parts playing peek-a-boo, then by all means buy these pants. Otherwise, these would be good for lounging around and running errands.\n",
      "perfect fit...love them !!\n",
      "Beautiful sage green and perfect fit!\n",
      "around the calves its a little large and does not hug my foot. maybe if i had gotten a smaller size it would work better\n",
      "Have bought 6-8 pairs of these leggings. Amazing! Squat proof! I'm a size 4/6 and bought mediums. Fit perfect. Will keep buying!\n",
      "I have had two pairs of these before that I had purchased at Marshalls so knew exactly how they fit and the nice quality of them.  I especially like that they have a small pocket in the waistband where you can put some money, a credit card or license, keys, etc. so you can be hands free.  They are of a good quality material that has stretch, some firmness control and no telltale see through.\n",
      "they fit fine, but the color I got was very see through! I can not speak for the other colors but the silver is transparent\n",
      "nice fit\n",
      "great product!! good tummy control! 5'7 140 medium fits perfect\n",
      "I like the color, length, and soft fabric however I wish it would be a little bit thinner.\n",
      "Absolutely love this brand of leggings. These are true squat non see through Capri! They feel so comfortable I wear them everyday even underneath my skirts and dresses.\n",
      "These capris fit very nicely.  Not a capri-wearing lady, but after recent abdominal surgery, I needed some stretchy-style pants to wear until I could fit into my regular clothes.\n",
      "These were really comfortable and the color is very versatile.\n",
      "Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars:  I ordered 2 different brands of capris, and one of them is now spamming me with email marketing messages.  DO NOT appreciate that!\n",
      "Love, love, love these pants! Absolutely a must have! I have the &#34;mom stomach&#34; and these help control it ☺️\n",
      "I love love love these capris. They are a great value, the cut is complementary, and the length is perfect (I'm 5' 6&#34;). Just the thing I need to wear with tunics and tees and sandals. They'll be perfect for fall, too, with my Converse. I ordered 3 of these and already own 4 of the longer length yoga pants from 90 Degree by Reflex.\n",
      "I really like the quality of these yoga pants but I wish they had a length option for shorter people. I'm 5'5&#34; and I ordered the cropped ones and they awkwardly end just above my ankles not at my calves like I expected.\n",
      "They fit to size, feel amazing and I look thinner lol\n",
      "Seriously they are well made and wash really good!\n",
      "Will buy MANY many more of these pants! I was contemplating busting out $100 for some lulu. However, I found these originally at TjMaxx and fell in love with them immediately. They feel like skin, but not too thin. I've worn other very thin yoga pants that showed my cellulite, but these do NOT show through at all! I am 5'3&#34; and I do have to bunch them up jussstttt a little so the ankle/calf opening isn't gaping. Sort of expected at this height though.\n",
      "None\n",
      "Very comfortable pants! I'm 5'2 and about 135 pounds and ordered a a black in medium, though I think I could've gotten away with a small. I have thicker thighs and calves and smaller waist, which means that many tights fit me too tight around my legs. However, this isn't a problem with these! I also love that they aren't see through.\n",
      "Overall, I'd definitely recommend and am considering ordering other colors.\n",
      "Love this company! Every pair of pants that I have purchased, and I think I have 5, are amazing! Great fit! Great feel! Will definitely continue to order. Company also has amazing customer service- after receiving a defective pair, they quickly shipped out a new pair.\n",
      "None\n",
      "None\n",
      "Love these!\n",
      "Fit great! Passes the bend over test. Material is thick but not heavy. I was concerned that the light color would show cellulite on the back of my legs but it camouflaged wonderfully! The color is vibrant and fun!\n",
      "None\n",
      "Awesome quality with very high-end feel. Fit is perfect (XL for 190 lb weight). Very complementary. Bought these to wear as a capri-layer under tropical print boutique dress but they are substantial enough to wear as exercise tights without it looking tacky.  Looks fantastic!\n",
      "Bought these to match a specific workout top and while the color is nice, the fit and material aren't particularly flattering, and what's worse is they show every drop of sweat... even in the knees (yeah, who knew knees sweat?!) but the crotch area was particularly mortifying. These might be fine for yoga but wouldn't recommend for anything more sweaty or strenuous than that.\n",
      "Love these so much!\n",
      "I'm very athletic, with a smaller than normal waist due to my weight lifting & high levels of cardio, so they fit a little large around the waist!\n",
      "If you an average body, then these pants would probably fit perfectly\n",
      "None\n",
      "None\n",
      "The best darn deal for capris I have yet to discover.  They fit like a dream!  Medium is a medium.  The crotch behaves as one would hope as in no creeping up anywhere it should not.\n",
      "I tried on SO many pairs of work out pants and could not find any that fit the way I needed them to. I figured I would give these a try and they are amazing! The high waist gives acts as a control top and the fabric does not cut into my crotch in an unappealing way. Sorry for that visual but it is a real problem when it comes to these types of pants. I am very happy with my purchase.\n",
      "I LOVE these yoga pants.  I have a collection! BEST exercise pants I've found!\n",
