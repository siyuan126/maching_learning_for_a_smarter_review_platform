# maching_learning_for_a_smarter_review_platform
This is the repo for my fourth project at Metis. I performed Topic modeling on over 1,600 reviews on yoga pants sold on Amazon to find what customers care about the most and how the product is described.
And then I designed a smarter review platform to save online shoppers' time and make it easy for business to collect reviews from customers.
